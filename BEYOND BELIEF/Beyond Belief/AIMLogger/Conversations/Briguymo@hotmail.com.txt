Hey Brian
briguymo@hotmail.com says:
what are you doing these days?
Terry_VB says:
Coming out of the HIV closet
briguymo@hotmail.com says:
really.. to whom?
Terry_VB says:
well, I had a little help.  A server at work found out I was poz and was telling people, and it got back to me on Monday of this week
briguymo@hotmail.com says:
i see.. and so.. 
Terry_VB says:
I was mad at first, then I let it go realizing that there was good in this, too... I just had to figure out what
briguymo@hotmail.com says:
YOU KICKED HIS ASS
Terry_VB says:
Then I realized, that was the best thing he could've ever done for me
Terry_VB says:
It gave me the courage and strength I needed to tell people I wanted to but didn't 
briguymo@hotmail.com says:
amazing how free the feeling is
Terry_VB says:
He may think he harmed me, but he didn't
Terry_VB says:
He helped me
Terry_VB says:
It boggles me that I can come to that feeling within 24 hours of it happening, but I did.
briguymo@hotmail.com says:
It builds up.... and over time is damanging
briguymo@hotmail.com says:
like being your own prisoner
Terry_VB says:
I don't feel like a prisoner.  He gave me the power to want to tell people before he had the chance
briguymo@hotmail.com says:
well good.. now you are emancipated
Terry_VB says:
I suppose I am
briguymo@hotmail.com says:
Nice to see you.. 
briguymo@hotmail.com says:
have you met anyone nice lately?
briguymo@hotmail.com says:
any fun?
Terry_VB says:
I meet nice people every day, but romantically, no.
briguymo@hotmail.com says:
i see.. 
briguymo@hotmail.com says:
well come on out here
briguymo@hotmail.com says:
we can fix that
Terry_VB says:
That sounds very nice, but I'm ok without sex right now
briguymo@hotmail.com says:
 am not looking for just sex
Terry_VB says:
Since Friday the 13th, I've come to realize that I was filling a void in my life with sex, and that's what got me into the situation I'm in now.  I have to fill the loneliness with myself, otherwise I'll never grow
briguymo@hotmail.com says:
i want someone nice and special
Terry_VB says:
I know you're not
Terry_VB says:
I know.  Me, too
briguymo@hotmail.com says:
so you could come out.. we can see the area.. get to know each other
briguymo@hotmail.com says:
and see how it goes
briguymo@hotmail.com says:
You seem nice
Terry_VB says:
Thank you.  I like to think I am
briguymo@hotmail.com says:

Terry_VB says:
Thanks
Terry_VB says:
I don't know when I will be able to come out there, though.  
Terry_VB says:
Since I missed a lot of work last month, I am doing all I can to rememdy a solution now that I'm working again
briguymo@hotmail.com says:

briguymo@hotmail.com says:

Terry_VB says:
all of my credit cards and bills are a month behind now
briguymo@hotmail.com says:

briguymo@hotmail.com says:
