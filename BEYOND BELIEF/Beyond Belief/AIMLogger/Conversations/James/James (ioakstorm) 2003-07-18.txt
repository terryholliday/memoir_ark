ioakstorm: k, brb
terry_holliday: ok
ioakstorm: back
ioakstorm: got it?
terry_holliday: yeah, I was waiting for you to get back
ioakstorm: right on
terry_holliday: I gave it to her on her birthday last year
terry_holliday: it's called "Faith"
terry_holliday: My gift I give to you today
Is one that can't be bought,
But words laid out in careful rhyme
With lots of love and thought.
terry_holliday: You are my mom, my hero, too
When I was just a babe,
You held a cool cloth on my head
To comfort all my pains.
terry_holliday: You are a mom that everyone
Wished their mom would've been,
You cooked and cleaned and washed our clothes,
Picking toys up hours on end.
terry_holliday: No one on earth could take your place,
You are my rock of faith,
You've held our family closely knit
And kept us in our place.
terry_holliday: You give so much unselfishly
You care not who or why,
But that they need it "more than you,"
Is all that you reply.
terry_holliday: You gave us wings so we could fly
But leaving was our choice,
"You're always welcome back," you said,
In your caring tone of voice.
terry_holliday: You are my mom, my one true thing
The lighthouse to my sea,
When there's a storm within my life
Your faith helps me believe.
ioakstorm: beautiful
ioakstorm: makes me want to go wake my mom up to hug her
ioakstorm: :)
terry_holliday: aww
ioakstorm: i know she loved it
ioakstorm: you there?
terry_holliday: yeah
terry_holliday: she did
ioakstorm: youre very direct, its refreshing
terry_holliday: in what way are you talking?
ioakstorm: I mean that you arent hiding anything , youre letting your words say what you mean
terry_holliday: ahhh.... yeah
terry_holliday: and I think that's what most people find so different about my writing
terry_holliday: I speak from a level most people don't
ioakstorm: mm very true
ioakstorm: i like to hide in images and shadow in metaphor
ioakstorm: so im a bit darker 
ioakstorm: mind if i read one?
terry_holliday: not at all
ioakstorm: cool, here goes
ioakstorm: "sunset"
ioakstorm: Do the stars cry?
ioakstorm: Do they melt into pools and escape some distant eye?
ioakstorm: A tear
ioakstorm: that grows long on our face
ioakstorm: and shudders the mouth of the horizon?
ioakstorm: Do they weep for the dying sun
ioakstorm: who damns the turning earth with red fingers
ioakstorm: leaving us endlessly molested by silence?
ioakstorm: Do they express on blind eyes?
ioakstorm: or can all see 
ioakstorm: the saline chariot blazon lucid
ioakstorm: and amniotic
ioakstorm: to quicken procreation?
ioakstorm: Stars dont cry-
ioakstorm: stars dont molest, they caress
ioakstorm: stars dont express , they create
ioakstorm: stars dont cry, they wash our inspiration.
ioakstorm: ............

terry_holliday: ok
ioakstorm: so there I am , sitting in the faggy part of the Zocalo 
ioakstorm: eating my lunch
ioakstorm: cruising the boys and never really intending to follow through
ioakstorm: the tragedy of eating alone
ioakstorm: and the bright Mexican sun is beating down on me ala Camus
ioakstorm: as I sit under the language barrier
ioakstorm: And an old woman walks up to me
ioakstorm: where I sit
ioakstorm: enter tragedy again
ioakstorm: she is poor
ioakstorm: and wants me to buy some of her trinkets
ioakstorm: little bookmarks
ioakstorm: the zapotec woman, standing there , touching my shoulder
ioakstorm: the end of centuries of aztec tradition
ioakstorm: turned in her face, whittled and lathed
ioakstorm: but strong as ever in her features
ioakstorm: and asks me to buy
ioakstorm: and I say "no gracias"
ioakstorm: and now the comedy
ioakstorm: as I am sitting there
ioakstorm: she teaches me a valuable lesson
ioakstorm: the years of oppression and poverty
ioakstorm: in her face and body
ioakstorm: that brought her to my table that day
ioakstorm: and my no gracias
ioakstorm: makes her reach out
ioakstorm: and grab my diet cock

terry_holliday: I'll bet
ioakstorm: but i cant fault the woman
ioakstorm: i empathized as much as i could
ioakstorm: and understood
ioakstorm: however, I applaud her boldness, and salute her bravery
terry_holliday: old people don't care
ioakstorm: nah , not at all

terry_holliday: lol, none
ioakstorm: <smile>
ioakstorm: brb
terry_holliday: k
ioakstorm: ok back
ioakstorm: do you know the zen story about the monk being chased by a leopard?
terry_holliday: no
ioakstorm: its short i promise :)
ioakstorm: mind if i share it?
terry_holliday: sure
ioakstorm: a zen monk is being chased through the forest by a leopard
ioakstorm: the monk is running along when he spots a tree and jumps up into it
ioakstorm: the leopard follows the monk
ioakstorm: and is walking along the branches after him
ioakstorm: the monk slips down onto a vine
ioakstorm: and the leopard is left in the tree with no way to get the monk
ioakstorm: the monk looks down and sees a writhing mass of poisonous snakes below him
ioakstorm: above the leopard
ioakstorm: and below the snakes
ioakstorm: the monk looks over
ioakstorm: and on the thin vines on the tree is a single berry
ioakstorm: the monk reaches over and pops the berry into his mouth
ioakstorm: and savors the taste thuroughly
ioakstorm: the end....
ioakstorm: :)
terry_holliday: so what's the moral?
ioakstorm: what else could the monk do?
ioakstorm: but enjoy the time he had
terry_holliday: ah, true
ioakstorm: that one hit me over the head like a mallet
ioakstorm: i love koans like that
terry_holliday: it makes sense
ioakstorm: very much so
terry_holliday: I'd just hold on until the snaked moved
ioakstorm: perhaps he did, but faced with that situation, i would have made that berry the best berry ever
terry_holliday: you know it tasted good
ioakstorm: oh definitely
ioakstorm: and it might not be what he wanted at that moment, but... its what he was given
terry_holliday: yup
ioakstorm: anyways
ioakstorm: sorry
ioakstorm: im just blabbing
ioakstorm: lol
terry_holliday: I'm still talking to this guy
ioakstorm: very good
ioakstorm: he did respond finally?
terry_holliday: he's paranoid now about wehther I precum
terry_holliday: did I stick it in without a condom?
terry_holliday: etc
ioakstorm: i hate to say it, but Im glad he is worried
terry_holliday: I am glad he is, too
terry_holliday: It was a wake up call for me
terry_holliday: but had I not become HIV positive, I would have never stopped giving myself so freely
ioakstorm: what do you mean?
terry_holliday: sexually
terry_holliday: I thought I should be grateful if someone found me attractive and wanted me
ioakstorm: ahhh
ioakstorm: sorry i got dc'd
terry_holliday: that's ok
terry_holliday: I'm still here
ioakstorm: mind if I ask how you feel about that now?
terry_holliday: about what?
ioakstorm: about being grateful if someone found you attractive
terry_holliday: well, I'm still flattered when someone finds me attractive... that's just my insecurity
terry_holliday: but I value my body more than I did
ioakstorm: thanks
terry_holliday: I do miss the companionship
terry_holliday: and the sex
terry_holliday: but I believe I was looking for something in others that I should've been finding in myself
ioakstorm: you are in my thoughts and prayers
terry_holliday: thanks
terry_holliday: well, I guess we'll see how he handles it from here
terry_holliday: he is going to go get tested
ioakstorm: good, Im glad to hear it, is he beyond the window?
terry_holliday: what do you mean?
ioakstorm: that 4-6 month window, 
ioakstorm: where the virus might not be detected
terry_holliday: no, I had sex with him on June 9th.  It's been almost 6 weeks, which is enough time for antibodies to exist
ioakstorm: mmm, 
ioakstorm: wishing him luck
terry_holliday: I don't think he has anything to worry about
ioakstorm: prolly not
ioakstorm: but you never know
ioakstorm: fate is a fickle mistress
terry_holliday: I hope I did not transmit it to someone else
terry_holliday: the burden of being poz is hard enough
ioakstorm: yes love
ioakstorm: I hope you didnt either
ioakstorm: and you prolly didnt
ioakstorm: but it is how it goes
terry_holliday: this has been an emotionally exhausting day
terry_holliday: I have told quite a few people today 
ioakstorm: Im sorry hon, anything I can do for ya?
terry_holliday: naw, I'm doing well
terry_holliday: just saying it's been draining
ioakstorm: yeah, 
terry_holliday: all preparing me for when I have to tell my mom
terry_holliday: which will be the hardest thing I've done in my life
ioakstorm: oh sweetheart, I thought you had told her
terry_holliday: no, but she knows something is up
terry_holliday: When I went home to WV for my nephew's 3rd birthday last weekend, she asked me if I was feeling ok?
terry_holliday: and the time before that, she gave me vitamins and made sure I took them home
terry_holliday: and baked me some cookies
ioakstorm: mmm, you think she suspects
terry_holliday: her intuition knows, whether she wants to consciously acknowledge it or not
ioakstorm: yes exactly
terry_holliday: her motherly instincts have kicked in
ioakstorm: she senses something is wrong
terry_holliday: yeah, she just doesn't know what
ioakstorm: it'll be difficult, but you will be ok 
terry_holliday: yeah
