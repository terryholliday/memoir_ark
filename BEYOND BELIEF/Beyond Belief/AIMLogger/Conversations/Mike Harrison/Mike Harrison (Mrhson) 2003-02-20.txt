sup, sexy man?
Mike says:
just a sec...
Mike says:
Ok.  Hi.
Mike says:
Sexy eh?
Mike says:
I don't know about that.
Mike says:
But thank you anyway.
Terry_VB says:
puhlease
Mike says:
All you've seen are pictures.
Terry_VB says:
All that matters is what I think, don't you remember?
Mike says:
And pictures are deceiving.
Mike says:
No, that I clearly don't remember.
Terry_VB says:
I think your personality is sexy
Mike says:
Oh, okay, I'll grant you that one.
Terry_VB says:
dont' worry... that's my one compliment for the week
Terry_VB says:
I won't be giving any more
Mike says:
Wow, you've saved your one compliment for the week for me.  How generous.  Your other friends will be jealous.
Terry_VB says:
Well, I won't tell them
Mike says:
They'll just go on thinking you're mean.
Mike says:
And they'll be all misapprehended about the whole thing.
Terry_VB says:
yup.  That's all right.  What they don't know won't hurt them
Mike says:
How's the restaurant business?
Terry_VB says:
It's going all right.  Just got home a little while ago
Mike says:
The lunch crowd...
Terry_VB says:
yeah, I don't like them as much as dinner
Mike says:
You're earning your keep okay?
Terry_VB says:
I had to miss yesterday b/c I was sick
Mike says:
Sorry.
Mike says:
Has the snow effected you?
Terry_VB says:
naw
Mike says:
I mean, did you get any.
Terry_VB says:
nope
Terry_VB says:
just rain
Mike says:
Boo.
Terry_VB says:
at least you didn't have a car to dig out
Mike says:
Exactly.
Mike says:
The one parked across from my apt I watched get buried first by the fall then by the plows.
Mike says:
It's still there, unmovable.
Mike says:
I keep expecting a big plow to hit it by accident.
Terry_VB says:
you guys are wimps... we used to have to deal with that stuff all the time in WV
Mike says:
I'm not a wimp with it.
Mike says:
I grew up in Michigan.
Terry_VB says:
I didn't say YOU... I said you guys
Mike says:
But I don't mind having nothing to plow in my apartment and getting a free day to spend at home.
Mike says:
Well, I'm a guy.
Mike says:
 
Terry_VB says:
I hope
Mike says:
Rest assured, I am.
Terry_VB says:
I would say prove it, but I know you won't
Mike says:
Well, I certainly couldn't at the moment.
Terry_VB says:
well, I've waited almost a year to meet you, I guess I can wait a little longer to find this out
Mike says:
And, seen another way, this was simply the first thing you knew about me.
Mike says:
Back to fundamentals.
Terry_VB says:
that's right.  back to basics
Mike says:
Hi, Terry. I'm Mike.
Mike says:
(how's that for basic?)
Terry_VB says:
stats?
Terry_VB says:
lol
Mike says:
5'11" 150 lbs 32w br/br wm
Terry_VB says:
yummy
Terry_VB says:
top/bottom?
Terry_VB says:
=)~
Mike says:
can't say--I'm at work.
Terry_VB says:
unh huh
Mike says:
Think what you wish.
Terry_VB says:
I think I remember what you told me last year anyway
Mike says:
It hasn't changed.
Terry_VB says:
   didn't figure it had... and it's not like it matters 
Mike says:
Certainly not from this distance.
Terry_VB says:
it's not that far
Terry_VB says:
we all live under the same sky
Mike says:
True enough, but greater proximity is needed for certain classifications to gain any meaning or relevance.
Terry_VB says:
I disagree.  A relationship has whatever meaning we give it
Mike says:
Yes, a relationship, sure.  I meant the specific catagories you mentioned.
Mike says:
I'm intentionally being a little difficult.
Terry_VB says:
I know
Terry_VB says:
 
Terry_VB says:
This is us
Mike says:
Being difficult to one another every few weeks.
Terry_VB says:
Being difficult is our way of flirting
Mike says:
Flirting?  
Terry_VB says:
yes, flirting
Mike says:
(more like being coy)
Terry_VB says:
call it what you want
Mike says:
Okay.
Mike says:
I'll call it "interacting with you."
Terry_VB says:
works for me
Mike says:
During the snow days, I noted that Dr Phil has his own show.  I thought of you.
Mike says:
And it was the first time I had ever seen this man you speak about all the time.
Terry_VB says:
yeah, I dont' like his show as much as I liked him on Oprah's show
Mike says:
It's didn't seem like good watching.
Mike says:
But I don't watch a huge amount of tv to start with.
Terry_VB says:
Did I tell you I've started to keep an online journal for my friends to stay updated with my life?
Mike says:
NO.
Mike says:
No, rather.
Mike says:
Didn't mean to yell.
Terry_VB says:
damn straight you better stop yelling at me
Mike says:
Just a typo.
Mike says:
Like whispering in an echo-ie room.
Terry_VB says:
ahhh
Terry_VB says:
well, anyway... yeah, I've created a blog online to keep my stories, etc.
Mike says:
A generous thought.
Terry_VB says:
http://puzzleoflife.blogspot.com
Mike says:
I see.
Mike says:
This is quite extensive.
Terry_VB says:
The first entry is an email from Neale Donald Walsch, the author of the Conversations with God series
Terry_VB says:
it's a speech by Senator Byrd   WV on the war with Iraq
Mike says:
Yes, I see.
Terry_VB says:
the following is my reply to Neale, with my story
Terry_VB says:
which... is... quite... extensive
Mike says:
As I already suspected.
Terry_VB says:
because nothing I do is short?
Mike says:
Everything you do is thoughtful and broad.
Terry_VB says:
well, I couldn't just write him a short "howdy-do" letter when he's such an incredible person who I wanted to make a profound impact on.
Mike says:
Of course, I get that.
Terry_VB says:
I'm glad you understand
Mike says:
Better a howdy-do letter than a howdy-dowdy letter.
Terry_VB says:
do most people get your sense of humor?
Mike says:
"Get" is all relative.  Let's just say many people put up with me.
Terry_VB says:
I mean I like your sense of humor, but from my experiences, it doesn't seem that most people could get it.  You have a Frasier sense of humor (which I love Frasier)
Terry_VB says:
but not everyone gets those jokes
Terry_VB says:
or silly puns
Mike says:
or good puns.
Mike says:
I hang out with and work with people who tend to get my jokes.
Terry_VB says:
Obviously, I think you're funny or I wouldn't keep talking with you
Terry_VB says:
*nods* but you work at a museum
Mike says:
Thanks.
Mike says:
So, I guess most people don't get my humor, but most peole don't ever hear it.
Terry_VB says:
because you're so shy
Mike says:
Sure, we'll caulk it up to that.
Terry_VB says:
don't you have to catch your ride soon?
Mike says:
yes.
Mike says:
I was just getting my last stuff from the printer.
Mike says:
And asking my coworker if she's about ready to leave.
Mike says:
I wasn't too shy to ask her that.
Terry_VB says:
lol
Terry_VB says:
I would hope not
Mike says:
These personal interactions can be difficult.
Terry_VB says:
shaddup
Terry_VB says:
=)~
Mike says:
It's a daily struggle.
Terry_VB says:
hey, I'm the smartass
Terry_VB says:
k?
Mike says:
Can I grant you smart and ass, but not nec'ly together?
Terry_VB says:
LOL
Terry_VB says:
yes, you can
Mike says:
We'll run with that then.
Terry_VB says:
  deal
Mike says:
I do have to go though.
Terry_VB says:
*nods*
Terry_VB says:
I know
Terry_VB says:
it was nice seeing you 
Mike says:
Same here.  "Thank you, come again."
Terry_VB says:
lol, you're getting better
Mike says:
 
Terry_VB says:
Have a good night, sexy man
Mike says:
Thanks; you too.
