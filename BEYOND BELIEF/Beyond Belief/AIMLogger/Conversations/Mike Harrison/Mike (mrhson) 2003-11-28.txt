Hey you
Mike says:
Hi.
Mike says:
Happy thanksgiving.
Terry_VB says:
Happy Thanksgiving to you, too
Mike says:
Where are you spending the holiday?
Terry_VB says:
at home... most of my family came in from WV
Mike says:
Has it been fun?
Terry_VB says:
so far, yeah... I have been so tired this week after coming home from Durham... I haven't felt like doing much other than sleeping
Mike says:
How was the work in Durham?
Terry_VB says:
very inspirational, but very exhausting
Mike says:
Hence the sleepiness...
Terry_VB says:
nothing gets by you
Terry_VB says:
 
Terry_VB says:
so how are things going with you?
Mike says:
Quite well.
Terry_VB says:
found a replacement boyfriend yet?
Mike says:
Um, maybe.
Terry_VB says:
still test driving him?
Mike says:
If you mean that with the double meaning, than no.
Mike says:
We've been out about 6 times, and he is very sweet.
Terry_VB says:
no, I meant testing him out to see if he's boyfriend material
Terry_VB says:
6 times and you don't know yet?
Mike says:
I'm pretty sure he is.
Terry_VB says:
that's awesome.  I told you that you wouldn't be single long
Mike says:
The strength of my feelings here is not being conveyed by my convention of understating and qualifying most everything I say .
Mike says:
He likes me, I like him, he's bright, in-touch, generous, etc. etc.
Terry_VB says:
sounds like a winner to me
Mike says:
We'll just wait and see.
Terry_VB says:
just go with the flow... that's all you can do
Mike says:
That's just what I am doing.
Mike says:
And how are you doing after the Italian guy?
Terry_VB says:
he's leaving on Monday to go back to Italy
Terry_VB says:
but he was only interested in me as being a sweet friend anyway
Mike says:
yeah, you'd said that.
Terry_VB says:
I only got to hang out with him once when I was in Durham... I was just so busy with work.  But he met some guy a week or so ago that he's dating now
Terry_VB says:
He's happy... that's all that matters
Mike says:
How's the family?
Terry_VB says:
They're doing all right... They're shopping somewhere
Terry_VB says:
I think they'll be here till Sunday
Mike says:
Shopping?  The day after Thanksgiving?
Mike says:
Heavens.
Terry_VB says:
I know.  It's some silly tradition they have
Mike says:
I've just been sitting inside all day.
Mike says:
Paying bills, cleaning house.
Terry_VB says:
I really don't want to fight the traffic on the roads and in the stores
Mike says:
I don't really enjoy holiday shopping.
Terry_VB says:
me, either
Mike says:
Sorry--distracted--reading email.
Terry_VB says:
it's ok.  I'm still here
Mike says:
English friends wishing me happy thanksgiving.
Mike says:
Oh, my exhibition openned, by the way.
Terry_VB says:
awesome.  when did that happen?
Mike says:
Last Saturday.
Mike says:
My mom came to town for the occation.
Terry_VB says:
pretty special event then, huh?
Mike says:
http://americanhistory.si.edu/onthemove/index.html
Mike says:
There were a number of opening parties, and 11,000 people came through the museum the first day.
Terry_VB says:
wow
Terry_VB says:
I like this site
Terry_VB says:
it's neat
Mike says:
People seem to like it.
Mike says:
It's really big, as you know.
Terry_VB says:
bigger the better
Mike says:
People seem a little overwhelmed by it.
Mike says:
ha, ha
Mike says:
Is it raining down there too?
Terry_VB says:
it was supposed to, but it hasn't been since I've been awake
Mike says:
I need to run a errand to the photo shop, but I don't want to go outside.
Terry_VB says:
well, don't go
Mike says:
Yeah, but I've had these two roles of film waiting to be processed forever.
Mike says:
And I need an album for my England pictures from last summer.
Terry_VB says:
then why don't you just go to the photo shop and come back home?
Mike says:
Oh, you're too reasonable.
Mike says:
That is of course exactly what I should do.
Terry_VB says:
We both know that
Terry_VB says:
you just needed to hear someone else remind you
Mike says:
Yeah, that's the problem with spending the whole day alone.
Mike says:
On the other hand, it's very quiet here.
Terry_VB says:
it's very quiet here now, too, with everyone shopping
Mike says:
I had dinner with friends yesterday, but it was noisy.
Mike says:
Hours and hours of loud conversation.
Mike says:
Interrupted by a bird and some smashed cranberries.
Terry_VB says:
lol
Terry_VB says:
sounds like a great Thanksgiving
Mike says:
They're good friends, so it was fun.
Mike says:
The food was amazing.
Mike says:
But now I don't have any leftovers at home.
Mike says:
I'll have to make myself a pie this evening.
Terry_VB says:
yeah, that's the only part that sucks about eating at someone else's house
Mike says:
Although, come to think of it, they planned quite well and about the only thing left over was bird and half a cake.
Mike says:
We finished almost everything else.
Terry_VB says:
wow
Mike says:
And we did not particularly gorge ourselves.
Terry_VB says:
brb
Mike says:
ok
Terry_VB says:
back
Mike says:
Ok.
Mike says:
I think I should go run my errand.
Terry_VB says:
I think you should, too
Mike says:
And maybe stop at the grocery store.
Mike says:
No good reason to starve.
Terry_VB says:
yeah, you shouldn't starve
Mike says:
I already don't think I've been eating enough recently.
Terry_VB says:
you need to... you're skinny
Terry_VB says:
you'll blow away in the wind
Mike says:
Oh, there's a reason to stay home...
Mike says:
Now I'm just being silly.
Mike says:
Okay, well off I go.
Terry_VB says:
lol
Mike says:
I'll talk to you again soon.
Terry_VB says:
have a good one
Mike says:
You too.
Mike says:
Enjoy the family's visit.
Terry_VB says:
I'm sure I will
Mike says:
 
Terry_VB says:
take it easy
Mike says:
You too.
