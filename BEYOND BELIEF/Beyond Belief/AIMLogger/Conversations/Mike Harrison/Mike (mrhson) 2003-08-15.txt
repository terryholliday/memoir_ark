Hey stranger
Mike says:
And who are you again   
Terry_VB says:
   How have you been?
Mike says:
Not so bad.
Mike says:
Some recent turmoil, but otherwise slow.
Terry_VB says:
*nods*  I'm no stranger to the rain
Mike says:
How are you?
Mike says:
Hopefully not in the rain at present?
Terry_VB says:
Happiness is a decision not an experience
Mike says:
It can't be both?
Terry_VB says:
It can if you choose to experience happiness.
Mike says:
Good answer.
Mike says:
How have you been keeping busy of late?
Terry_VB says:
working & sleeping
Mike says:
Any exciting travel recently?
Terry_VB says:
naw
Mike says:
Where is work these days?
Terry_VB says:
I'm still at PF Chang's
Mike says:
Good.  That seems to be working well.

Terry_VB says:
it's all good
Mike says:
What was it?
Terry_VB says:
was just going to send you my newest picture
Mike says:
How bout by email?
Terry_VB says:
http://my.gay.com/terry_vb 
Mike says:
Or, that works...
Mike says:
Same smile as always.
Mike says:
I should scan some of my pictures from my June trip to England.
Terry_VB says:
yes, you should
Terry_VB says:
So are you still dating the same guy?
Mike says:
I'm afraid it's almost at an end, barring some drastic change that isn't likely.
Terry_VB says:
You know what needs to be done
Mike says:
Yes, indeed.  I just tend to put these things off.
Terry_VB says:
You need to be true to yourself, Mike
Mike says:
Absolutely.  I tend to overthink things, and I'm often too nice.
Mike says:
Neither of which will change anytime soon.
Terry_VB says:
I understand you don't want to hurt anyone, but how long are you going to deny your intuition of what you need to do because of fears?
Mike says:
Clearly, I have a high threshold for this sort of thing.
Mike says:
It's very clear what I need to do.
Mike says:
I just need to do it.
Mike says:
I've been talking to all my friends about this this week.
Mike says:
Had a nice chat with my mom tonight.
Terry_VB says:
Well, just trust that you're doing everything you need to, and in the right time
Mike says:
And it's not that I don't like him, just that the relationship is not sustainable.
Terry_VB says:
The relationship no longe reflects who you are and who you see yourself being
Mike says:
Yes.
Mike says:
And we haven't been able to make it better.
Terry_VB says:
well babe, he has to know this, too
Terry_VB says:
so it won't come as a great surprise
Mike says:
What is an argument against any delay.
Mike says:
But enough about me and my state of affairs.  Are you seeing anyone?
Terry_VB says:
nope.  still single
Mike says:
No one interesting has come and gone since we talked last?
Terry_VB says:
oh, lots of interesting people have come and gone, but that's all they've done
Mike says:
ha ha
Terry_VB says:
how much time do you have to talk, and I'll try to come up with a summation of all that's gone on in my life since we last spoke?
Mike says:
I'm not in a huge hurry, but summaries are always good.
Terry_VB says:
hang on, brb
Terry_VB says:
ok, back
Mike says:
okay
Terry_VB says:
you know, let me forward you an email that has everything in it
Mike says:
okay
Terry_VB says:
ok, mrhanson@hotmail.com right?
Mike says:
mrhson
Terry_VB says:
oops
Mike says:
It's not like that bit of info was on the quiz...
Mike says:
there it is.
Mike says:
Shall I read now or later?
Terry_VB says:
it's up to you... it's not a very short summation, but then again, is anything with me ever short?
Mike says:
No everything with you is very long.
Mike says:
 
Terry_VB says:
at least where my life's drama is concerned
Mike says:
Big news I see.
Terry_VB says:
pretty big
Mike says:
Thanks for sharing.
Terry_VB says:
no problem  
Mike says:
You're doing okay?  (I haven't finished reading yet...)
Terry_VB says:
yeah, I'm doing fine
Mike says:
One of my closest friends is also positive.
Terry_VB says:
we're everywhere
Mike says:
My comment  doesn't seem terribly relevant here, however.
Mike says:
Oh, but I see there is a job promotion tucked here at the end of the message.
Terry_VB says:
*shrugs*  now that's unclear
Terry_VB says:
They haven't said anything more to me about it
Mike says:
Oh.  We'll just have to be patient about that one, then.
Terry_VB says:
Everything happens for a reason
Mike says:
yes
Terry_VB says:
no matter what, I'm sure I'll make the most of it
Mike says:
Everything is an opportunity for growth.
Mike says:
But you have to choose to make it so.
Terry_VB says:
yup
Mike says:
Although sometimes one has to be dragged kicking and screaming thorough growth.
Terry_VB says:
that'd be me
Mike says:
Or me for that matter.
Terry_VB says:
Some changes you have no choice
Terry_VB says:
...but to embrace it
Mike says:
Yes.
Mike says:
You have to accept what you cannot change, but your attitude towards those things is in your control.
Mike says:
So now you're just working and sleeping?  No other exciting things to be a-doing on a Friday night?
Terry_VB says:
naw, I only got up from my nap b/c I realized I hadn't eaten anything but bread today and was hungry
Mike says:
Yeah, I had a headache this evening because I didn't eat enough for lunch, and what I did have I ate too early.
Mike says:
I tend to work through lunch, which I shouldn't do.
Terry_VB says:
I work through lunch, too
Mike says:
I get a lot done, but then I get headaches.
Terry_VB says:
*nods*
Terry_VB says:
you should buy those snack bars then
Terry_VB says:
to tide you over until you can eat
Mike says:
I should.  I try not to keep food at my desk, though, as I work near collections storage areas at work.
Mike says:
Bugs, etc.
Terry_VB says:
well, you don't have to worry about that if it's sealed
Mike says:
True, with bars and stuff.  Can't keep bags of pretzels, for instance.
Terry_VB says:
*nods*  Well, that's what they make ziplock baggies for
Mike says:
I've never seen a pretzel-shaped ziplock bag...
Mike says:
I must not shop at the right stores.
Terry_VB says:
ah, you mean a BIG pretzel
Terry_VB says:
for that, you'd need a freezer bag
Mike says:
No, I was imagining little bags in the pretzel shape in which you would stack, one on top of another, 20-30 small pretzels.
Mike says:
(was making a joke)
Terry_VB says:
Damn, and it went right over my head
Terry_VB says:
That happens sometimes when I watch Frasier, too
Mike says:
They put pretzels in bags on Frasier?  I haven't seen that one...
Terry_VB says:
lol, no... but sometimes they make jokes I don't get
Mike says:
It's good for a sitcom to surpass one's expectations.
Terry_VB says:
I'm going to be in DC on Thursday, the 28th.  What are you doing that evening?
Mike says:
let me see...
Mike says:
I have ringing practice from 7-9 at the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue.
Mike says:
But I'm free before or after that.
Terry_VB says:
I'm meeting one of my friends there on Thursday evening, so I'm not sure exactly what the plans are right now... but I'll know closer to the day
Mike says:
Okay, we'll just figure it out by email.  And you have my cell number?
Terry_VB says:
you know, let me make sure I still do... I have a different cell phone now
Terry_VB says:
202-277-5072?
Mike says:
That's it.
Terry_VB says:
still got it
Mike says:
Good.
Mike says:
You're coming to town just to visit friends?
Mike says:
Which is, of course, sufficient reason of itself, not meaning to imply otherwise.
Terry_VB says:
yeah, they want to go to Philly on Friday, but I dunno.  I try to take things one day at a time
Terry_VB says:
but given that I've never met you in the year and a half that I've known you, I'd like to kill as many birds with one stone as I can
Mike says:
Well, I'm not sure I can go to Philly on Friday...
Mike says:
 
Terry_VB says:
I'm not sure I want to go to Philly on Friday, either
Terry_VB says:
Did I ever tell you my Philly story?
Mike says:
You've hinted at it.
Terry_VB says:
Reader's Digest Version:  The very first guy I had sex with was in Philly.  I haven't been back since... and that was 1997
Mike says:
It was either very good and you don't want to tread on the experience for fear of dulling the memory, or it was very bad and you don't like the associations...
Terry_VB says:
It was not very good and I wasn't too impressed with what I saw of the city
Mike says:
I like Philly.
Mike says:
But I've never had sex there.
Terry_VB says:
yeah, well I'm sure that wouldn't be a bad thing... if you aren't a naive 19-year-old from West Virginia
Mike says:
I lived there for four years.
Mike says:
And was kinda naive at the time.
Terry_VB says:
maybe it would be good for me to go back with friends to re-experience the city
Mike says:
There is some very interesting stuff there.
Mike says:
Pretty rowhouses
Mike says:
Historic buildings
Terry_VB says:
trash on the streets
Mike says:
You have to overlook that to see the rest.
Terry_VB says:
*nods* 
Mike says:
There's this great historic prison there that you can tour.
Mike says:
It's been empty for years.
Mike says:
Was built in the 1830s
Mike says:
Fascinating stuff.
Terry_VB says:
hrmmm
Terry_VB says:
I will ask Brian if he knows where it is
Mike says:
It's Eastern State Penitentiary, on Fairmount Ave. I think.
Terry_VB says:
I assume he knows his way around... because I don't
Mike says:
I think I need to turn in for the evening, Terry.
Terry_VB says:
ok Mike
Terry_VB says:
thank you for helping me feel better
Mike says:
It's great talking to you.
Mike says:
Sorry your were feeling great to start with.
Mike says:
Thanks for sharing your news.
Terry_VB says:
well, you mean a lot to me
Terry_VB says:
I couldn't imagine not sharing it with you
Mike says:
Sorry I don't have anything more meaningful to say about these things.
Terry_VB says:
It's ok
Mike says:
I'll need to let it sink in.
Terry_VB says:
There's nothing you could say that I haven't already told myself
Mike says:
Than I'll just offer a *hug* and say good night.
Terry_VB says:
g'nite
Terry_VB says:
 
Mike says:
