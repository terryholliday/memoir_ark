Terry_VB says:

Mike says:
I've been working.
Terry_VB says:
you expect me to believe that
Mike says:
Yes.
Terry_VB says:
unh huh
Mike says:
I've been reading the script for the exhibition.
Mike says:
It's been on my desk for two weeks.
Mike says:
But I've been focused only on the image id's and captions.
Terry_VB says:
you need to hurry up and finish so you can help me write these grant requests
Mike says:
I haven't read it all the way through.
Mike says:
I don't like writing grant requests.
Terry_VB says:
well, I've never done it
Mike says:
I have to write an article about the subdivisions that make up my neighborhood.
Mike says:
Might start that tomorrow.
Mike says:
Most grants come with guidelines.
Terry_VB says:
yeah, I have seen that
Mike says:
Just follow the guidelines.
Mike says:
Be direct, and postive.
Mike says:
Don't be overly wordy.
Terry_VB says:
isn't that me?
Terry_VB says:
well, sometimes I can be wordy
Mike says:
Don't gild the lilly.
Terry_VB says:
I'll remember that
Mike says:
Oh, I'm mentioned on teh Historical Society's webpage:  http://www.hswdc.org/
Terry_VB says:

Terry_VB says:
Michael Richard Harrison?
Mike says:
Robert
Terry_VB says:
*nods*
Terry_VB says:
cool.  you're famous
Mike says:
At least locally.
Terry_VB says:
and that's enough for me
Mike says:
I don't know anything about the history of VB, however.
Mike says:
At least not yet.
Terry_VB says:
me, either
Mike says:
It may not be your cup of tea.
Terry_VB says:
I do know the history of Witchduck Lake
Mike says:
Is that in WV?
Terry_VB says:
no, In VB
Mike says:
Don't know of it.
Terry_VB says:
didn't figure you would
Terry_VB says:
It's just a lake where they used to drown suspected witches.  If they threw them in and they sank, they weren't a witch, but if they floated, they were and they burned them at the stake.  Either way, they were fucked
Mike says:
Seems strange for Virginia.
Terry_VB says:
are you kidding?
Terry_VB says:
this is Pat Robertson headquarters
Terry_VB says:
Jerry Fallwell on our left
Terry_VB says:
and Pat on our right
Mike says:
Yeah, but witch baiting is so 17th century.
Mike says:
And so New England.
Terry_VB says:
well, I think it was back in the 1700's
Terry_VB says:
I forget
Terry_VB says:
they had it on the news
Mike says:
I'll believe you.
Mike says:
No such stuff in DC.
Terry_VB says:
so liberal
Mike says:
We developed later.
Terry_VB says:
I am so horny this evening!
Terry_VB says:

Terry_VB says:

Mike says:
Hitting those internet sites again, eh?
Terry_VB says:
naw
Terry_VB says:
just horny
Mike says:
Hmm.
Terry_VB says:
Hmm?
Terry_VB says:
what are you thinking?
Mike says:
Not sure how to respond to your declaration of horniness.
Mike says:
Noting witty sprang to mine.
Mike says:

Terry_VB says:
lol
Terry_VB says:
sorry, I know it was a little TMI
Terry_VB says:
but I just wanted to share it with you
Mike says:
TMI?
Terry_VB says:
Too much information
Mike says:
I see.
Mike says:
Well, it did fill in a picture, I suppose.
Terry_VB says:
a good one, I hope
Mike says:
Reminded me of two pictures I already have.
Terry_VB says:
LOL
Terry_VB says:
That's need-to-know information though
Mike says:
But I've never seen the movies.
Terry_VB says:
but you will
Mike says:
Is that a promise or threat?
Terry_VB says:
I hope it's a promise
Terry_VB says:
cuz I'd never threaten you
Mike says:
I'm making a joke.
Terry_VB says:
not with my dick
Terry_VB says:
that would hurt
Mike says:
indeed
Terry_VB says:
my dick...
Terry_VB says:
It figures you'd be online the one evening I have plans
Mike says:
I'll go away.
Terry_VB says:
no
Mike says:
I mean, your plans are your own business.
Terry_VB says:
no, one of my friends (another Michael) invited me to a party at his house
Terry_VB says:
I hung out with my friend Tracy until like 9:30
Terry_VB says:
I have to go to Richmond tomorrow to meet my attorney
Terry_VB says:

Mike says:
I see.
Terry_VB says:

Terry_VB says:
strategy
Terry_VB says:
on her own time
Terry_VB says:

Mike says:
