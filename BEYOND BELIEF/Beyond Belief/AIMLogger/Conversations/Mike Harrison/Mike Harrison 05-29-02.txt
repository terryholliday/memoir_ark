Terry_VB says:
Hey you
Mike says:
there you are.
Terry_VB says:
   here I am
Terry_VB says:
right where I needed to be
Mike says:
Just checking email and I logged on to see if you were about.
Terry_VB says:
I know
Terry_VB says:
 
Mike says:
You know that's why I signed on?
Terry_VB says:
I didn't know that's why you signed on
Terry_VB says:
but I knew I was thinking about you
Terry_VB says:
more than usual
Mike says:
Why more than usual?
Terry_VB says:
I don't know why
Terry_VB says:
I just couldn't get you out of my mind
Terry_VB says:
so I came here
Mike says:
Since I only exist here.
Mike says:
Or on the phone.
Terry_VB says:
but most importantly, you exist in my mind's eye and in my dreams
Mike says:
So I can be whatever you desire.
Terry_VB says:
and you are
Mike says:
I am whatever?
Terry_VB says:
you're exactly what I desire
Terry_VB says:
in my mind
Mike says:
At this distance, I can't disappoint.
Terry_VB says:
I know what I know
Terry_VB says:
and every day I like you more and more
Mike says:
A friend in Ireland was telling me about this fireman he dated.  I thought of you and your firemen.
Terry_VB says:
 
Mike says:
Have any more visits from them today?
Terry_VB says:
not from them, no
Terry_VB says:
but you were in my thoughts   
Mike says:
I don't put out fires, though.
Terry_VB says:
no, you ignite them 
Mike says:
Me the big pyro.
Terry_VB says:
did you get my message?
Mike says:
Not that I know of.
Terry_VB says:
I called your cell phone at 10
Terry_VB says:
do you know Arian McCarthy?
Mike says:
No, it's off.
Terry_VB says:
yeah, I left a voice mail message
Terry_VB says:
it wasn't anything urgent
Terry_VB says:
really just wanted to hear your voice
Terry_VB says:
although, your voice mail voice is not as sexy as the live phone voice
Mike says:
It's still me.
Mike says:
Who's Arian McCarthy?
Terry_VB says:
*shrugs*  someone my best friend Alison knows
Terry_VB says:
She's a buyer at the museum you work for
Mike says:
At my museum or at the Smithsonian in general?
Terry_VB says:
you said you work for the National Museum of History, right?
Mike says:
Close.  Nat'l Mus. of Amer'n History.
Terry_VB says:
that's right
Mike says:
Is this Arian a man or woman?
Terry_VB says:
woman
Terry_VB says:
Alison said she thought she was a buyer for the museum
Terry_VB says:
it's not important
Terry_VB says:
she just wanted to know if you knew her
Mike says:
Don't know her.
Mike says:
I think I should turn in.
Mike says:
Long day.
Terry_VB says:
You know, I was in the middle of a movie
Terry_VB says:
Hearts In Atlantis
Terry_VB says:
and then just had the incredible urge to come on here
Mike says:
You can go finish it in a minute.
Mike says:
to come on here?
Terry_VB says:
*nods*
Mike says:
sounds messy.
Terry_VB says:
lol
Terry_VB says:
you are so rotten
Terry_VB says:
and flirtatious
Mike says:
just horny.
Terry_VB says:
well, that's even better
Mike says:
No it isn't.
Terry_VB says:
I think it is
Mike says:
I have to take care of it myself.
Terry_VB says:
for now
Mike says:
Exactly.
Terry_VB says:
but that's ok
Terry_VB says:
close your eyes
Terry_VB says:
I'll send you images
Mike says:
(you've already sent me images!)
Terry_VB says:
I'll send you mental images you haven't yet seen
Terry_VB says:
I just want to hug you, Mike
Mike says:
Thanks.  I'm too far away for that.
Terry_VB says:
speaking of which
Terry_VB says:
is it too soon to ask when we can meet?
Terry_VB says:
I do need those books, you know
Mike says:
VB has no libraries?
Terry_VB says:
yes
Terry_VB says:
I don't know why I didn't think of that
Mike says:
I do.
Terry_VB says:
why?
Mike says:
You'd rather borrow mine.
Terry_VB says:
for several reasons, yes
Mike says:
A weekend would be best for a visit, but I don't have many free ones.
Terry_VB says:
I understand
Mike says:
coming up at least.
Terry_VB says:
I'm amazingly being more patient than usual
Terry_VB says:
which is very odd for me
Mike says:
But better for you.
Terry_VB says:
yes, I know it is... 
Terry_VB says:
but
Terry_VB says:
I can't explain it
Mike says:
Okay, I won't ask you to.
Terry_VB says:
just listen to your thoughts
Terry_VB says:
and you won't need me to
Mike says:
Okay.
Mike says:
It's time for bed.
Terry_VB says:
ok
Terry_VB says:
will I see you tomorrow?
Mike says:
In your dreams.
Mike says:
 
Terry_VB says:
you read my mind
Terry_VB says:
yet again
Terry_VB says:
I'll see you there tonight
Mike says:
The firemen will be very disappointed when I make my appearance.
Terry_VB says:
the firemen won't be there
Terry_VB says:
just you and me
Mike says:
What if I'm elsewhere?
Mike says:
My dreams range far, you know.
Terry_VB says:
you were in my dreams this morning
Terry_VB says:
I woke up thinking about you
Mike says:
Hmm.
Terry_VB says:
what's on your mind?
Mike says:
That was not that kind of hmm.
Terry_VB says:
I didn't say it was
Terry_VB says:
I asked a question
Mike says:
There's nothing on my mind behind it.
Terry_VB says:
   I wasn't asking about your "hmm"
Terry_VB says:
but ok
Mike says:
My mind in on the bed yonder.
Terry_VB says:
I understand
Terry_VB says:
sleep with angels, my prince
Terry_VB says:
until next time, thank you for making me smile
Mike says:
Your welcome.
Mike says:
Sleep well.
Mike says:
Talk to you later.
Terry_VB says:
   ok
