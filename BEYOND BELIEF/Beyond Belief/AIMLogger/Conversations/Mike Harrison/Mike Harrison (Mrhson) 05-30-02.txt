Mike says:
Hey there.
Terry_VB says:
whatcha up to?
Mike says:
Looking up something.
Mike says:
Checking email.
Mike says:
Writing a thank you note.
Terry_VB says:
It's good to be grateful
Terry_VB says:
and to express that gratitude
Mike says:
Not so much grateful in this instance; just appreciative of a kindness.
Terry_VB says:
*nod*
Mike says:
Friend in northern ireland sending me commemorative covers.
Terry_VB says:

Mike says:
So far just the once.
Terry_VB says:
did you like it?
Mike says:
Had a very nice time.
Mike says:
Was there in Feb.

Met most of my London friends there.

Mike says:

Terry_VB says:
and bottom
Mike says:
well, enough catagories for now I suppose.
Terry_VB says:
categories, I thought we were talking about positions
Mike says:
We started at positions, started toward catagories.
Terry_VB says:
couldn't they be both?
Mike says:
Sure.
Mike says:
They often are.
Terry_VB says:
 
Mike says:
Catagories is actually a parlor game, also called Guggenheim.
Terry_VB says:
wasn't there a millionaire named Guggenheim?
Mike says:
A family of them.
Terry_VB says:
I thought so
Terry_VB says:
One of them died on the Titanic, right?
Mike says:
Benjamin
Mike says:
and his valet.
Terry_VB says:
can you read my mind?
Mike says:
No.
Terry_VB says:
why not?
Mike says:
I'm not trying to.
Terry_VB says:
but if you were?
Mike says:
If I were really trying, I suppose.
Terry_VB says:
actually, even when you're not
Mike says:
No.
Terry_VB says:
why not?
Mike says:
I choose not to.
Terry_VB says:
but why wouldn't you want to?
Mike says:
Like being alone with my own thoughts.
Terry_VB says:
ah
Terry_VB says:
but you share your thoughts with me sometimes
Mike says:
But I still don't read yours.
Terry_VB says:
but I want you to
Mike says:
You can just tell me what's on your mind.
Terry_VB says:
yeah, but that takes half the fun out of it
Mike says:
But leaves you with complete agency over yourself.
Terry_VB says:
I suppose
Mike says:
It does.
Mike says:
still out there?
Terry_VB says:
yeah, sorry
Terry_VB says:
got sidetracked reading
Terry_VB says:
you know how hypnotizing these IRS publications can be
Mike says:
anesthetizing would be more like it.
Terry_VB says:
that, too
Mike says:
Reading for your business?
Terry_VB says:
yeah
Terry_VB says:
the nonprofit stuff
Terry_VB says:
tell me what you visualize when you think of RIGHT ANSWERS
Mike says:
Right answers in what context?
Terry_VB says:
as in the correct answers
Terry_VB says:
RyterAnswers.com
Terry_VB says:
I'm trying to come up with a short, sweet, and memorable site name
Terry_VB says:
the others are too long
Mike says:
Right answers sound rather authoritarian and proscriptive.
Terry_VB says:
my best friend Pat keeps telling me I need a trademark that's memorable
Terry_VB says:
that when you see it, you think of Ryter
Mike says:
I still what to know what answers you're providing.
Mike says:
Or, I guess that was solutions I was questioning.
Terry_VB says:
Imagine taking a search engine to the next level
Terry_VB says:
and creating a network like MSN
Mike says:
You could just call it Answers.
Terry_VB says:
Answers.com is taken
Terry_VB says:
so is Ask.com
Mike says:
Answers.org
Terry_VB says:
it's taken as well
Mike says:
Buy them out.
Terry_VB says:
I suppose I could
Mike says:
Might have to wait tables a bit more than you planned.
Terry_VB says:
I don't know what I'm going to do when I start waiting tables
Mike says:
You'll gather the tips.
Terry_VB says:
lol, I would hope
Mike says:
So whats to know?
Terry_VB says:
I meant time management-wise
Mike says:
How much time does your business take at the moment?
Terry_VB says:
pretty much from the time I get up until the time I go to bed
Terry_VB says:
I am either networking or doing paperwork
Mike says:
I don't think you'll have problems with time management.
Terry_VB says:
naw, I've worked 2 full time jobs before
Mike says:
See. No problem.
Terry_VB says:
I don't know what I was thinking
Mike says:
Just needed reminding?
Terry_VB says:
I'm just not looking forward to doing it again
Mike says:
Are you going to be waiting tables full time?

Terry_VB says:
yup
Mike says:
I see.
Mike says:
When will that start.
Terry_VB says:
I am assuming next week
Mike says:
They have hired you?
Terry_VB says:
They did 2 years ago
Terry_VB says:
I just couldn't go through their training at the time
Terry_VB says:
it conflicted with my f/t job
Mike says:
With planning your business.
Terry_VB says:
no, I got hired at Olive Garden 2 years ago when I worked at GEICO
Terry_VB says:
Olive Garden's training was during the day when I was at work at GEICO
Mike says:
I see.
Terry_VB says:
but... the service mgr is on vacation this week
Terry_VB says:
the manager at Capt. George's (a seafood buffet/sit-down restaurant) said they would be hiring starting next week
Terry_VB says:
I applied there back in April
Mike says:
A plethera of choices.
Terry_VB says:
yes & no
Mike says:
Okay, so two choices.
Terry_VB says:
well, there are others... I just know that the waitstaff at Capt. Georges make mad money
Terry_VB says:
and I know a couple of waiters at Olive Garden
Mike says:
I guess mad money is better than funny money.
Terry_VB says:
from what I hear
Mike says:
I think I'm going to go to bed now.
Terry_VB says:
ok dude
Terry_VB says:
thanks for all your help
Mike says:
Don't know that I've been very helpful.
Terry_VB says:
sure you were
Mike says:
But you're welcome
Terry_VB says:
 
Mike says:
I'll talk to you later, then, Terry.
Terry_VB says:
I sure hope so
Mike says:
good night.
Terry_VB says:
Good night, boo
Terry_VB says:
sweet dreams
