Mike says:
Still there?
Terry_VB says:
Yup
Mike says:
I'm back.
Mike says:
What have you been up to?
Terry_VB says:
Oh gosh, Mike... several chapters in my book
Terry_VB says:
never a dull moment in my life
Mike says:
That's very good.
Terry_VB says:
well, I haven't written the chapters.  I just experienced them 
Mike says:
Yes, exactly.
Terry_VB says:
Let me do a reading for you, to see what's going on with your relationship
Mike says:
Which sort of reading?
Terry_VB says:
tarot reading
Mike says:
Okay.
Terry_VB says:
Focus: The focus is on unexpected developments and occurrences in love affairs or personal relationships; motion, messages, and controlled reactions; workable ideas and concepts to further growth; and/or a person with a Taurean-type temperament.
Terry_VB says:
Desire: You want success or cooperation in business and/or matters of the heart.
Terry_VB says:
Romance: You will want to walk away from or forget a painful relationship, but wont' be able to.
Terry_VB says:
The Unexpected: You are going to be very surprised by the return of a lover, and an unexpected turnabout in matters of the heart ... a positive development.
Terry_VB says:
Others: You will be put in a position you won't want to be in and will feel incapable of finding a solution; but a significant adjustment will be made, and pressure will ease off.
Mike says:
Reading.
Mike says:
Interesting.
Mike says:
What do you make of this?
Terry_VB says:
Well, the guy you're dating... he's too timid for you, right?
Mike says:
Pretty much.
Terry_VB says:
Well, a person with a Taurean-type temperament is directly opposite of that
Terry_VB says:
Taurean's are very strong willed. Their sign is the Bull
Mike says:
I see.
Terry_VB says:
I think you're going to have trouble telling this guy it's over
Mike says:
I always do.
Terry_VB says:
Well, you dont' want to hurt feelings
Mike says:
Nope.
Mike says:
When is Taurus?
Terry_VB says:
Well, it doesn't necessarily mean someone born under the Taurus Sun
Terry_VB says:
it said a Taurean-type temperament
Terry_VB says:
but they are 3/23 - 4/22
Mike says:
I get it.
Terry_VB says:
I think this guy is going to do something that's going to make it easier for you to tell him.  
Mike says:
Well, he may move away.
Terry_VB says:
Which would give you the perfect window to tell him 
Terry_VB says:
LDR's don't work
Mike says:
If he moves away, the relationship will end--can't have a romantic relationship based on a few months acquaintance when there is no prospect of seeing the person.
Terry_VB says:
nope
Mike says:
Time will tell.
Mike says:
Thanks for the insight.
Mike says:
How's your business?
Terry_VB says:
I haven't done shit with it the last few months, Mike.
Terry_VB says:
I've had too much other stuff going on
Mike says:
Such as?
Terry_VB says:
sorry, phone
Terry_VB says:
well, I started a new job at PF Chang's back in September
Terry_VB says:
and had to learn a lot of new stuff in order to be good at my job
Terry_VB says:
there, for awhile when I was working at Ruby Tuesday's, I wasn't making but maybe $30/40 a day in tips so all I could do was keep my head above water.
Mike says:
You're getting better tips at Chang's, I hope.
Terry_VB says:
oh, my yes
Terry_VB says:
last night, after tipping out $50, I still made $103
Mike says:
Very nice.
Terry_VB says:
I've been averaging like $525-$550 in tips a week, which isn't too bad
Terry_VB says:
I can make it on that
Terry_VB says:
I'm going back to school soon
Terry_VB says:
maybe in the spring
Mike says:
What are you planning to study?
Terry_VB says:
Political Science
Mike says:
Where?
Terry_VB says:
I don't know.  I want to go to one of the best schools in the area for that, but I dont' know whether ODU or Virginia Wesleyan would be better
Mike says:
I don't know much about either.
Terry_VB says:
I've checked out ODU's website
Mike says:
Seems promising?
Terry_VB says:
It looks good to me
Terry_VB says:
I just haven't checked out VW's
Terry_VB says:
I've got to figure out my living situation before I figure out the school part
Terry_VB says:
My landlord is selling my house
Mike says:
hang on, phone
Terry_VB says:
Hey, I have to get in the shower for work
Terry_VB says:
I have tomorrow off, so I'll look for you then.
Terry_VB says:
I've missed talking to you
Terry_VB says:
 
Terry_VB says:
have a good evening
