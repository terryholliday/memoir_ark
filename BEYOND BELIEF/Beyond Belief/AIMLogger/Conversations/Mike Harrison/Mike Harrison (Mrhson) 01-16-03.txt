But sweet.
Terry_VB says:

Haven't felt ready to get out.

Yes.
Terry_VB says:
ok 
Mike says:
And how is your social life?
Terry_VB says:
I've got guys coming out of the woodwork
Terry_VB says:
don't want a one of em
Mike says:
I know what that's like.
Mike says:
You just need one you like.
Terry_VB says:
well, I like certain things about all of them, but not enough for one of them to fulfill enough of my needs to stop dating
Terry_VB says:
Plus, I'm still holding out for you
Terry_VB says:
=)~
Mike says:
Very sweet.   
Mike says:
I haven't forgetten that you want to come visit when I'm available.
Mike says:
Have been happily surprised that my current engagement has continued and improved.
Terry_VB says:
I'm glad it has gotten better for you
Mike says:
I have a friend in NY who is actually trying to set me up with someone else.
Mike says:
He thinks I should be dating someone else, and has made it his project to get me to switch.
Mike says:
I've politely told him to butt out.
Terry_VB says:
maybe you shouldn't completely shut out his efforts to help
Mike says:
No, I appreciate his opinions, and that his concern comes from the heart.
Mike says:
But he is being a bit too forceful about it, I think, and I said as much.
Terry_VB says:
ahh
Mike says:
He's heard me talk with ambivilance about the bf, and hasn't heard quite so well that I think it's gotten better.
Mike says:
And I like to think I can make up my own mind about the worth of the situations I'm in.
Terry_VB says:
I know you can.
Terry_VB says:
I wanna see a picture of this guy you're dating
Mike says:
okay
Mike says:

Terry_VB says:
damn sunglasses... 
Mike says:
They do protect the eyes.
Terry_VB says:
yeah, but I can't look INTO his eyes
Terry_VB says:
You can tell so much about a person by their eyes
Mike says:
I'm not sure that picture'd be good enough for you to see his eyes anyway.
Terry_VB says:
*nodS*
Terry_VB says:
oh well
Mike says:
If I get a better one, I'll send it your way.
Terry_VB says:
no worries... I'm sure it'll be a coon's age before we talk again
Terry_VB says:
by then, you may not even be with him
Mike says:
All possibilities.
Terry_VB says:
exactly
Mike says:
Anything else new?
Terry_VB says:
sorry, was doing a reading to see if it gave me any insight into your situation
Terry_VB says:
there's always something new with me, Mike... you oughta know better than to open THAT flood gate
Mike says:
Well, I trust your ability to filter and maybe tell a little, interesting, telling, nugget of news.
Mike says:
(What's the reading say?)
Terry_VB says:
most of what you've already told me
Terry_VB says:
I only really looked at the relationship part
Mike says:
Wouldn't want you to pry too much!   
Terry_VB says:
I'm going to shuffle the cards again and see if I get a similar card
Mike says:
It'll certainly be the same size and shape.
Terry_VB says:
ha ha.  Let's not forget who the smartass between the two of us is, ok?
Mike says:
There is strong competition there, I'm sure.
Terry_VB says:
ok, here's some of what the second reading says... which is a lot like the first one
Terry_VB says:
Desire: You want things to change (this could be concerning a loved one), and to break free of oppression or stagnation in business or find a solution to problems.
Mike says:
(maybe he'll come out to his parents.)
Terry_VB says:
Romance:  You will fear in your heart that you and your lover are not meant for each other, or that even if you did, it would just be a superficial relationship with no real depth or giving of one's self.
Mike says:
(that's not so far off)
Terry_VB says:
Others:  You will want to "move," incite, or motivate others and though you amy act distant, indifferent, or contrary to your nature, you will inwardly long for that which is meaningful
Mike says:
hmm
Terry_VB says:
Unions: You are going to unite with a business partner or loved one and will hope that a new approach will be successful.
Terry_VB says:
Emotional State: You will be changeable, edgy, and lackadaisical.
Terry_VB says:
Pleasure: You'll be happy about an invitation to a social event or outing... could be to a dress-up affair
Mike says:
(that'd be fun)
Terry_VB says:
Time:  In time, your desires will be realized, your social life will increase, and/or you will meet with or attract a new admirer.
Mike says:
(just what I need, another admirer)
Terry_VB says:
Mail: Someone is going to help you write or edit a letter, program, or document concerning your career or public relations
Terry_VB says:
Anxiety: You will feel repressed because things are not up to par, or as good as they could or should be.
Mike says:
(the mail one happened already today.)
Terry_VB says:
Disappointment:  You will be disappointed because you will have to put things off to another day, and also because the one who wants you isn't the one you want.
Mike says:
(that's a common anxiety)
Mike says:
(   )
Terry_VB says:
Endings:  Settling for less will come to an end.
Terry_VB says:
New Beginnings: You will take inventory and analyze issues from a different angle, but you will think about things, instead of actually doing them, until the right moment to act approaches.
Terry_VB says:
Fortune: You will have luck in attracting romance or meeting a new lover (or one from your past).
Terry_VB says:
Special Guidance: (Mundane) Change is in the air, and a new approach is at hand.  This could come through a friend who will help you "see the light" or attain a new perspective.
Terry_VB says:
(Esoteric) Be willing to wait, but don't compromise your self-esteem or avoid "warning" signs.
Mike says:
(
Mike says:
(This last one is nice)
Terry_VB says:
Best Course of Action: Pursue philosophical or intellectual hobbies, work, or lectures, and get things settled or down on paper up front.  That way there won't be any unpleasant surprises, and you won't end up sabotaging yourself.
Terry_VB says:
Outcome: When all is said and done, you will feel that things are just not worth the effort, and/or will avoid situations that frustrate, anger, or distress you.
Mike says:
That's quite a lot of information.
Mike says:
(I have to run to the bus stop in a minute.)
Terry_VB says:
*nods*  I figured you did
Mike says:
Somethings to think about.
Mike says:
Thanks.
Terry_VB says:
hopefully it'll give you some insight
Mike says:
yeah, I'll have to ruminate.
Terry_VB says:
It's been a pleasure talking to you again.   
Mike says:
Same here.
Mike says:
Take care of yourself.
Terry_VB says:
always
Terry_VB says:
you do the same
Mike says:
Thanks.
Mike says:
We'll talk soon.
Terry_VB says:
I'll keep ya in my thoughts
Mike says:
have a good evening.
Terry_VB says:
you, too
