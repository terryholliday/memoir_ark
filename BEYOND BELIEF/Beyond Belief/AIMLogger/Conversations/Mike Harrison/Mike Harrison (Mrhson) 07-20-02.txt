Terry_VB says:
Hey sexy
Mike says:
hey
Mike says:
how's things?
Terry_VB says:
they're just great, thanks.
Terry_VB says:
What are you up to this weekend?
Mike says:
I was helping a friend look at apartments, now I've been paying bills.
Terry_VB says:
Good times.
Mike says:
Well, paying bills is a necessity.
Terry_VB says:
one would hope
Mike says:
I hadn't done it for a while.
Mike says:
They were stacking up.
Mike says:
And the bank seems to have more money in my acc. than I have in my records.
Terry_VB says:
ah, but they usually find their mistakes
Mike says:
But the mistake doesn't seem to be obvious.
Mike says:
I think I must have added something up wrong.
Mike says:
But that's boring.
Terry_VB says:
to whom?
Mike says:
To me at least .
Mike says:
Possibly you too.
Mike says:
I mean, talking about financing is boring.
Terry_VB says:
naw
Terry_VB says:
not the best thing we could be talking about
Mike says:
Suggest a subject.
Terry_VB says:
lol
Mike says:
Or as the guy says
Mike says:
in one of our videos at the museum
Mike says:
"Press another subject."
Terry_VB says:
Why don't you pick the subject, since I'm more interested in learning more about you than you need to learn about me.
Mike says:
But you always have more to say than I do.
Terry_VB says:
I know.  It's a curse
Terry_VB says:
but I want to get to know more about you
Mike says:
I'm really not much fun.
Mike says:
Just a stick in the mud.
Mike says:
Paying bills on a Sat. afternoon.
Terry_VB says:
That's all a matter of perspective
Terry_VB says:
You're using your time wisely
Mike says:
Well, maybe.
Terry_VB says:
what are you doing tonight?
Mike says:
I have a birthday party to go to.
Mike says:
Couldn't find a gift.
Mike says:
It's hard to get something for a man who has too much clutter in his life.
Terry_VB says:
get a gift certificate
Mike says:
Yeah.
Mike says:
Bright boy you are.
Terry_VB says:
or, buy him a maid
Mike says:
She wouldn't do things right for him.  He's fussy and messy at once.
Terry_VB says:
Everyone pitch in and buy him a few therapy sessions then
Mike says:
That's the ticket.
Mike says:
The invitation says to "bring a friend."
Mike says:
Maybe I can pass one of my friends off as the gift.
Terry_VB says:
lol
Mike says:
My brick is getting dusty...
Mike says:
I have a brick on my desk.
Mike says:
I guess I could use that maid.
Terry_VB says:
Ah, I thought that's what you called your "tool"
Mike says:
Or maybe a houseboy.
Mike says:
No, I don't have any nicknames for that.
Terry_VB says:
I'll scrub your toilet
Mike says:
I wouldn't ask you to do that.
Terry_VB says:
but that's what a houseboy does
Mike says:
Oh, I was misinformed than...
Terry_VB says:
could we have hot sex after I got cleaned up?
Mike says:
Or even before you got dirty.
Terry_VB says:
or both
Mike says:
That's an idea.
Terry_VB says:
an idea I certainly could get used to 
Mike says:
Sex, followed by cleaning, followed by sex?
Terry_VB says:
yup
Terry_VB says:
or we could put off the cleaning until later and just have lots of sex
Mike says:
You should come as my guest to the party tonight.
Mike says:
That would space out the sex.
Terry_VB says:
You know I'd be looking for a bathroom or something at the party to hide in
Mike says:
Why?
Terry_VB says:
for sex
Mike says:
I'm slow occasionally.
Terry_VB says:
well, that's ok
Terry_VB says:
slow is good sometimes
Mike says:
oh, indeed!
Terry_VB says:
now I'm REALLY having visuals
Terry_VB says:
 
Mike says:
I'm sure that's not all your having.
Terry_VB says:
what else am I having?
Mike says:
Perhaps,
Mike says:
well,
Mike says:
a more
Mike says:
physical
Mike says:
reaction
Terry_VB says:
maybe.  are you?
Mike says:
I must confess.
Mike says:
I bit.
Mike says:
A bit
Terry_VB says:
I was gonna say, no biting, mister!
Mike says:
Typing error.
Terry_VB says:
   we'll let one slide
Mike says:
Jus t one?
Terry_VB says:
naw... as many as you make
Terry_VB says:
it's Saturday
Mike says:
it's harder to type while eating pretzels.
Mike says:
That's my excuse.
Terry_VB says:
you haven't mastered the art of multi-tasking
Terry_VB says:
I am offering a seminar in September
Mike says:
Mental multitasking I can do.
Mike says:
But pretzel typing is not often called for.
Terry_VB says:
well, mental multi-tasking is only part of the skill
Terry_VB says:
brb..  I need to get some water
Mike says:
Perhaps, I would offer, the most important part.
Mike says:
Ok.
Mike says:
The pretzels are making you thirsty.
Mike says:
Me too.
Mike says:
Would you get me a glass?
Terry_VB says:
*hands Mike a glass*  Here ya go
Mike says:
Thanks.
Terry_VB says:
No problem!
Mike says:
*picks up glass and sips*
Mike says:
*returns glass to coaster*
Terry_VB says:
I've missed you!
Mike says:
I haven't been around much.
Terry_VB says:
I know
Mike says:
Lots o' research.
Terry_VB says:
I know all about that
Mike says:
I can tell you many obscure things about residential development in late nineteenth century Washington.
Terry_VB says:
I can tell you lots about the major commercial web sites
Mike says:
We each have our areas of interest and expertise.
Terry_VB says:
Yup
Terry_VB says:
Are you going to be one of my Answer Experts?
Mike says:
Is there a wide need for information on the development of Washington?
Terry_VB says:
that's not all you're good at
Mike says:
No, but I believe in being modest.
Terry_VB says:
I know you do
Terry_VB says:
another thing about you I like
Terry_VB says:
What time is the party you're going to?
Mike says:
8
Terry_VB says:
see, I couldn't make it by 8 anyway
Terry_VB says:
 
Mike says:
No.
Mike says:
Ah well.
Mike says:
Save your gas money
Terry_VB says:
it would be well worth the gas money, though, to finally get to meet you
Mike says:
Someday.
Terry_VB says:
:-\
Mike says:
I may be around more in August.
Mike says:
My deadline is Aug. 2 for my current research project.
Mike says:
I'm thinking of turning my attention to steamboats on the Potomac.
Mike says:
for my next article.
Mike says:
I don't think there's been much work done on that subject.
Terry_VB says:
*yawn*
Mike says:
But I'll need to check.
Terry_VB says:
 
Mike says:
(beats banking chat)
Mike says:
Steamboats can't be less interesting than highway planning.
Terry_VB says:
I wouldn't think
Mike says:
Much more so in fact.
Terry_VB says:
What time are you going to be home from the party tonight?  Or do you have any idea?
Mike says:
I don't know.
Mike says:
People may go out after it.
Mike says:
And I haven't been out in forever.
Mike says:
So I might go too.
Terry_VB says:
You went out not too long ago
Mike says:
It clearly didn't make a big impression on me.
Terry_VB says:
clearly
Mike says:
What are you up to tonight?
Terry_VB says:
no clue
Mike says:
At least you won't be cleaning my house now.
Terry_VB says:
yes, but I won't be having hot sex with you tonight, either
Mike says:
No, there are trade offs.
Terry_VB says:
Yes, but I see no justice
Mike says:
Your reputation as a good boy will remain intact.
Terry_VB says:
Where did I get THAT reputation?
Mike says:
Well, I might be making that part up.
Terry_VB says:
just a lil
Terry_VB says:
 
Terry_VB says:
You can use the word "good" in many sentences about me, but not "good boy"
Mike says:
"He was good, boy."
Terry_VB says:
there ya go
Terry_VB says:
punctuation is everything
Mike says:
It is, good boy.
Terry_VB says:
Did I tell you I'm going to start waiting tables next week?
Mike says:
No.
Mike says:
Where?
Mike says:
Congratulations on the job.
Terry_VB says:
The restaurant in the Holiday Inn in Portsmouth
Terry_VB says:
thanks
Mike says:
Are you looking forward to it?
Terry_VB says:
I'm looking forward to making money
Mike says:
I'll have to show up unannounced to eat there sometime.
Terry_VB says:
why don't you show up unannounced at my house?
Mike says:
It's more devilish to show up at work.
Terry_VB says:
yes, but we could have more fun at my house
Mike says:
It's all about anticipation.
Terry_VB says:
I thought I told you I'm impatient
Mike says:
"slow is good sometimes"
Terry_VB says:
I've been more patient with you than I have any other guy I've met online and been interested in.
Mike says:
Well, is it possible to be impatient when I can't just show up at your door?
Terry_VB says:
no, but it's possible to finally be content
Mike says:
Can you be content with someone you haven't met?
Terry_VB says:
in a way, yes
Mike says:
Well, we'll just see what happens.
Terry_VB says:
Yes, but only if we make it happen
Mike says:
Yes, but I'm focused on my deadline at the moment.
Mike says:
As you noticed.
Terry_VB says:
I know.  
Terry_VB says:
and that's good that you're focused
Terry_VB says:
it just sucks that as your schedule opens up, mine becomes more hectic
Mike says:
Call it fate.
Mike says:
 
Terry_VB says:
bullshit!
Terry_VB says:
I create my own fate
Mike says:
I was being ironic.
Terry_VB says:
It's gonna happen
Mike says:
It's good to have faith.
Terry_VB says:
I couldn't imagine not having it
Mike says:
What's happened with your greeting cards idea?
Terry_VB says:
I haven't heard back from my mom yet
Mike says:
So that's on hold.
Terry_VB says:
for now, yes
Mike says:
Let's see if I can type and eat yogurt.
Terry_VB says:
You know, as appreciative as I am for you inviting me to go with you this evening, now it's making me pissed that I can't!
Mike says:
Don't let it bother you.
Terry_VB says:
Yeah, it's that easy
Mike says:
The timeing of this is out of your control.
Mike says:
Be disappointed and move on.
Terry_VB says:
bah
Terry_VB says:
I dont' really have a choice in the matter
Mike says:
Bah nothing.  Acknowledge how your feeling about it, then let it go.
Terry_VB says:
I have acknowledged how I feel about it, but I'm not letting go
Mike says:
Your choice.
Terry_VB says:
yup
Mike says:
Would it help if we talked more about houseboys?  I suppose not!
Terry_VB says:
No
Terry_VB says:
It's all your fault anyway... inviting me to a party you know I can't go to.  The nerve!
Mike says:
I didn't think of it until just then.
Mike says:
I'll take full responsibility.
Terry_VB says:
NOW I feel better
Terry_VB says:
=)~
Mike says:
 
Terry_VB says:
not really, but I can pretend
Mike says:
I know you have a vivid imagination.
Terry_VB says:
sometimes
Mike says:
sometimes?
Terry_VB says:
yeah, only sometimes
Mike says:
pish posh
Terry_VB says:
do you know you make my heart flutter just talking to you?
Terry_VB says:
course it could just be gas...
Mike says:
No, I didn't.
Mike says:
That puts me in my place, now.
Terry_VB says:
but you do!
Mike says:
Give you gas?
Terry_VB says:
no, make my heart flutter
Terry_VB says:
you always have
Mike says:
See you do have a vivid imagination.   
Terry_VB says:
it's not my imagination that is making my heart flutter
Mike says:
No, that's the gas.
Terry_VB says:
=)~  ooook
Mike says:
 
Terry_VB says:
dick tease!
Mike says:
Perhaps.
Mike says:
It's hard to do more at this distance.
Terry_VB says:
I know
Terry_VB says:
do you realize the end of this month will mark 3 months that we've known each other?
Mike says:
I haven't been counting.
Mike says:
This is good to know.
Terry_VB says:
me, either... but I just happened to think of it
Mike says:
We'll just have to set up something sometime.
Terry_VB says:
How does May of 2003 look?
Mike says:
Mostly open right now.
Mike says:
But by the end of hte week, who knows?
Terry_VB says:
*nods*
Terry_VB says:
well, one can hope for an opening
Mike says:
Indeed.
Mike says:
My show opens at the museum in November.
Mike says:
2003.
Terry_VB says:
I remember
Mike says:
You could come for that.
Mike says:
*Terry sticks his tongue out at Mike again*
Terry_VB says:
no, it was my finger
Mike says:
*Terry, provoked, makes rude but suggestive jestures to Mike*
Terry_VB says:
now if you'd only take me up on my suggestive jestures
Mike says:
Parts of me are up on your suggestive jestures.
Terry_VB says:
yes, but how does that help me!?!?
Mike says:
It hardly helps me either.
Terry_VB says:
yes, but I thought we were talking about me?
Mike says:
Okay, I suppose it doesn't help you too terribly much.
Terry_VB says:
not at all
Mike says:
No, just gives you more ideas.
Mike says:
More frustration.
Terry_VB says:
exactly!
Mike says:
More reasons to practice patience.
Terry_VB says:
bah
Terry_VB says:
I don't want to be too complacent, Mike.
Terry_VB says:
I like going after the things I want in life
Mike says:
"builds character"
Terry_VB says:
I have plenty of character
Mike says:
In both senses.
Mike says:
You still out there?
Terry_VB says:
yeah, I'm here
Terry_VB says:
trying to rid the frustration
Mike says:
Am I upsetting you?
Terry_VB says:
it's not you!
Mike says:
Am I interrupting?
Terry_VB says:
no, I'm not j/o
Terry_VB says:
I was trying to clear my thoughts
Mike says:
Okay, just checking.
Terry_VB says:
and accept, yet again, that I can't meet you yet
Mike says:
Perhaps I should go finish my bills while you relax.
Terry_VB says:
I'm ok
Mike says:
But I should get off the phone if I'm not chatting.
Terry_VB says:
oh!
Mike says:
Maybe my mom will call, and then the weekly talking will be on her bill.
Terry_VB says:
dont' you have free long distance on your cell phone?
Mike says:
I don't like the sound quality when calling home.
Terry_VB says:
*nods*
Mike says:
And the occational getting cut off.
Terry_VB says:
I understand that!
Terry_VB says:
Ntelos sucks
Mike says:
I have sprint.
Terry_VB says:
I'm sure they're better than Ntelos
Mike says:
They're not bad, but I dont' like talking for long periods on them.
Terry_VB says:
that makes perfect sense
Mike says:
I should probably go.
Terry_VB says:
ok
Terry_VB says:
It was good getting to talk to you again
Mike says:
Don't stay frustrated too long.
Terry_VB says:
I'll be all right
Mike says:
I'll be around.
Terry_VB says:
yeah, but I won't
Terry_VB says:
I'm sure I'll see you, though
Mike says:
At one time or another.
Terry_VB says:
if nowhere else, in my dreams
Mike says:
Exactly.
Mike says:
You have a good evening.
Terry_VB says:
Thanks
Terry_VB says:
have fun at your party
Mike says:
I'll try.
Terry_VB says:
and a good time aftewards
Mike says:
I will.
Terry_VB says:
afterwards
Terry_VB says:
   later
Mike says:
