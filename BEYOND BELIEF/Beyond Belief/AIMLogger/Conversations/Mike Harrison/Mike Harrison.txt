Terry_VB says:
Hey Mike
Mike says:
Hey there.
Terry_VB says:
I just woke up!   
Mike says:
Good heavens.
Terry_VB says:
I was tired
Terry_VB says:
I didn't go to bed until 3ish
Mike says:
But it's almost noon, forsooth
Terry_VB says:
I know... but the daggone phone has been ringing all morning
Terry_VB says:
AND, I haven't gotten more than 4 hours of sleep any night this week
Mike says:
And sleep is the best way to avoid answering the phone?
Terry_VB says:
um, I think so, yes
Mike says:
I've only done that once this week, and that was enough.
Terry_VB says:
I've just been on such a creative kick this week
Terry_VB says:
I've gotten SO much done
Terry_VB says:
but my sleep has suffered
Mike says:
Okay, so a trade off.
Terry_VB says:
It's been that way for over a month now
Terry_VB says:
I have yet to find balance
Mike says:
Work earlier in the day.
Terry_VB says:
You know... I've never been a morning person
Mike says:
go to bed at midnight.
Terry_VB says:
I can't!  Designing Women comes on at midnight
Mike says:
V
Mike says:
C
Mike says:
R
Terry_VB says:
I don't have time to record & watch all my shows
Mike says:
If you have time to watch it at midnight, you surely can have that time at another point in the day.
Terry_VB says:
ok, I know you're trying to make a point here somewhere
Mike says:
(This must be why I don't watch that much tv)
Terry_VB says:
I don't watch as much as I used to
Mike says:
You alone have the power to adjust the scheduling and balance of your life.  As I'm sure you know.
Terry_VB says:
yeah, I know
Terry_VB says:
Did I say I didn't like sleeping till noon?
Terry_VB says:
huh huh?
Terry_VB says:
did I?
Mike says:
You did.  And there are no excuses, just choices.
Terry_VB says:
I know
Terry_VB says:
I chose to stay in bed
Mike says:
More power to you!
Terry_VB says:
 
Mike says:
So what have you been getting done?
Terry_VB says:
well, I actually have to run right now... I just finally got to your email and wanted to say hello
Terry_VB says:
I have an appointment at 12:15
Mike says:
Okay.  Less talking, more running.
Terry_VB says:
LOL
Terry_VB says:
My friends would love THAT
Mike says:
You can quote me.
Terry_VB says:
lol, most of my best friends already know about you
Mike says:
Good heavens.
Terry_VB says:
Tracy said, "Where do you get all these hotties?"
Mike says:
They don't live nearby, you must say./
Terry_VB says:
Tracy lives in Hampton Va
Terry_VB says:
Thomas lives in Va Beach
Terry_VB says:
Alison lives in Va Beach
Terry_VB says:
Pat lives in WV
Mike says:
No, I meant that your reply would be that the hotties don't live nearby.
Terry_VB says:
Ahh....
Terry_VB says:
yeah, that's the ONLY bad thing 
Mike says:
Although I hardly qualify.
Terry_VB says:
pshh
Terry_VB says:
you are total hottie
Mike says:
ek
Terry_VB says:
AND
Terry_VB says:
I've never met a guy that uses words *I* have to look up
Mike says:
And all I'm doing is chatting
Terry_VB says:
I know
Mike says:
Jeez.
Terry_VB says:
isn't it amazing
Terry_VB says:
it's like you're on a pedestal  *cough*
Mike says:
No pedestals for me.
Terry_VB says:
that's why I coughed
Terry_VB says:
 
Mike says:
I thought maybe that was some doctor's exam joke.
Terry_VB says:
lol
Mike says:
 
Terry_VB says:
I couldn't let my PCP do that
Terry_VB says:
She and I have too close of a relationship for her cupping my balls
Terry_VB says:
I think that would just ruin it for me
Mike says:
Well, it is a necessary exam.
Terry_VB says:
yeah, I know... I meet a doctor online about every year or so
Terry_VB says:
if he doesn't find it while he's down there, they need to revoke his license
Terry_VB says:
 
Mike says:
gives a new meaning to socialized medicine.
Terry_VB says:
unh huh
Terry_VB says:
it sho does
Terry_VB says:
I dated a surgeon briefly about 3 1/2 years ago
Terry_VB says:
It's the intelligence     
Terry_VB says:
and he had a big dick
Mike says:
Not that he was a real cut-up?
Terry_VB says:
no
Terry_VB says:
He made me laugh
Terry_VB says:
just not LAUGH
Terry_VB says:
too serious sometimes
Mike says:
there are times for that.
Terry_VB says:
Oh yes, I have my serious times, too
Mike says:
Good to hear.  Your meeting fast approaches, and I should work.
Terry_VB says:
Yup.  I was just about to say "later"
Mike says:
Go have a productive day.
Terry_VB says:
"no better, no worse"
Mike says:
as it was, so it is
Terry_VB says:
as it should be
Mike says:
sometimes
Terry_VB says:
nope
Terry_VB says:
always
Mike says:
Without downs, we would have no perspective for appreciating the ups.
Mike says:
Nor reason to seek them.
Terry_VB says:
Over every mountain is a valley
Mike says:
And the other way around;
Terry_VB says:
true
Terry_VB says:
so what are YOUR big plans for the weekend?
Mike says:
Maybe I'll go seak a seer on one of those mountain tops.
Terry_VB says:
wow
Terry_VB says:
those are big plans
Mike says:
Just a thought.
Mike says:
Don't have any big plans.
Terry_VB says:
Have you seen Star Wars yet?
Mike says:
Monday night I'll go.
Terry_VB says:
*nods*
Terry_VB says:
Terry Holliday gives it 5 Stars * * * * *
Mike says:
You saw it?
Terry_VB says:
yeah, the other night
Terry_VB says:
at 12:15 a.m. with all the other freaks
Mike says:
(those were asterisks, btw)
Terry_VB says:
they look like stars to me
Terry_VB says:
change your perspective
Mike says:
Lando:  "You truely belong here with us among the asterisks."
Mike says:
Sorry work.  BAck now.
Terry_VB says:
me, too
Mike says:
So the movie gets five out of five?
Terry_VB says:
yes
Mike says:
Than I'll keep my plans of going to see it.
Terry_VB says:
Most definitely
Terry_VB says:
the storyline is graet
Terry_VB says:
great
Terry_VB says:
There's romance between Anakin & Queen Amidallo or whatever it is
Terry_VB says:
and Anakin is a fkn hottie
Mike says:
(Armadillo?)
Terry_VB says:
is that it?
Terry_VB says:
I don't know
Mike says:
You're going to call me a philastine in a second.
Terry_VB says:
I didn't see the first episode
Mike says:
Amidala.
Mike says:
Padme Amidala.
Terry_VB says:
Ahhhh
Terry_VB says:
yes, you definitely should go see it if you know the correct spelling of her name
Terry_VB says:
I just went for Ewan McGregor
Terry_VB says:
I would SO love to get him into bed
Mike says:
A fkn hottie, you say?
Mike says:
brb
Terry_VB says:
ok
Mike says:
back
Mike says:
Did you see Trainspotting?
Terry_VB says:
no... I haven't seen a lot of movies the last year
Terry_VB says:
I won't go by myself
Mike says:
It's from a few years ago, but it's good.  Had McGregor.
Terry_VB says:
Yeah, I fell in love with him in Moulin Rouge
Mike says:
Where he could even sing and dance/.
Terry_VB says:
I know!
Terry_VB says:
I downloaded the entire soundtrack
Terry_VB says:
Love is a... many splendid thing
Terry_VB says:
Love lifts us up where we belong
Terry_VB says:
All we need is love
Mike says:
(many splendored)
Mike says:
 
Terry_VB says:
oh, is that what it is
Terry_VB says:
that makes more sense
Mike says:
Looks like I'm going to NYC on the 29th.
Mike says:
I've been trying to get that meeting nailed down.
Terry_VB says:
I'm sure you'll have fun
Mike says:
A design meeting
Mike says:
for an exhibition about do it yourself home improvement
Terry_VB says:
That sounds neat
Mike says:
consumer-market powertools
Mike says:
hardware store retailing
Mike says:
This Old House.
Mike says:
Stuff like that
Terry_VB says:
gotcha
Mike says:
Are you going to Nags Head again?
Terry_VB says:
nope
Mike says:
A weekend at home?
Terry_VB says:
yeah, for the most part
Mike says:
Sounds like mine will be.
Terry_VB says:
when are we going to go on a date?
Mike says:
I'm free tonight.
Mike says:
But you haven't asked me out.
Terry_VB says:
I just did
Terry_VB says:
 
Mike says:
Well, at this rate it's going to have to be a phone date.
Terry_VB says:
why?
Mike says:
Not easy for me to drive over to your place.
Terry_VB says:
but I drive
Mike says:
And I live four hours away.
Terry_VB says:
3 - 3 1/2
Mike says:
Still
Terry_VB says:
Mike, trust me
Terry_VB says:
You would be WELL worth the drive
Terry_VB says:
besides, I love to drive
Mike says:
as it were
Terry_VB says:
but we can talk on the phone if you would prefer
Mike says:
It would behove us to do more of that before a date.
Mike says:
Given the distance.
Mike says:
And the price of gasolene.
Terry_VB says:
I understand what you're saying, but I also know what I know
Mike says:
Call me cautious, pragmatic.
Mike says:
Called away?
Mike says:
Hey, ring me up when you're back.'
Terry_VB says:
sorry... 
Terry_VB says:
home repair guy was here
Mike says:
Having your home repaired?
Terry_VB says:
yeah
Terry_VB says:
I guess I could wait until after you learn how to do it
Terry_VB says:
give me an excuse to watch you work
Mike says:
I just know the history of leaning how to do it.
Terry_VB says:
um, isn't that enough?
Mike says:
But I do have a toolbox.
Terry_VB says:
I have a screw driver
Terry_VB says:
 
Mike says:
That's a start.
Terry_VB says:
screw driver goes in the toolbox, right?
Mike says:
Much of the time.
Mike says:
So you have a screwdriver and you like to drive.
Mike says:
Hmm.
Mike says:
What conclusions could I draw?
Terry_VB says:
2 + 2 always equals 4
Terry_VB says:
I need to go get some water
Terry_VB says:
I'll brb
Mike says:
If it's fizzy water, you'l brp after your brb.
Terry_VB says:
lol
Terry_VB says:
no, regular water
Terry_VB says:
...so how long do I have to know you before I can have a date?
Terry_VB says:
and why do you have walls?
Mike says:
I assume you mean a date with me?  Maybe we wouldn't get along in person?
Terry_VB says:
We already know the answer to a question we don't ask is no.  We have nothing to lose by asking
Terry_VB says:
If nothing else, you can help expand my vocabulary
Terry_VB says:
Since you're the first person I've ever met to use farcical
Terry_VB says:
but now I know what it means
Mike says:
Well, one of these weekends you'll have to come up to DC.
Terry_VB says:
yeah, one of these weekends
Mike says:
And we can just see what happens.
Terry_VB says:
I'm currently scheduling for FY 2003
Mike says:
For some people that begins in a few weeks.
Terry_VB says:
true, but my fiscal year begins June 1
Terry_VB says:
I guess a year to get to know you via online isn't too long
Mike says:
You could come up on a weeknight.
Terry_VB says:
I sure could
Mike says:
I'm not free any weeknight until the 30th--honest truth
Mike says:
I'm a little horrifed by that.
Terry_VB says:
Um, you think my calendar is wide open, mister?
Mike says:
I was making no such assumption.
Terry_VB says:
I'm joking
Terry_VB says:
ha ha?
Mike says:
 
Terry_VB says:
well listen, you have my cell phone number... call it sometime and I can pencil you in
Mike says:
Okay.
Mike says:
Are you really interested in visiting sometime?
Terry_VB says:
I have been since I met you 
Terry_VB says:
Even BEFORE I saw your picture
Mike says:
Okay.  I believe you.  We'll figure it out then.
Terry_VB says:
I listen to my gut instinct
Terry_VB says:
it tells me you have a purpose in my life
Terry_VB says:
I don't have it ALL figured out yet
Terry_VB says:
but I'm anxious to see
Terry_VB says:
Otherwise, you wouldn't have merited a conversation with my best friends
Mike says:
So, I'm not just some wierdo you had to mention to your friends...
Terry_VB says:
nope
Terry_VB says:
Heck, I even dreamed about you
Mike says:
Darn.  And I was trying to hard.
Terry_VB says:
yeah, didn't work
Terry_VB says:
sorry  
Mike says:
Shucks.
Terry_VB says:
there's a million other guys where I came from
Mike says:
(working and chatting at the same time)
Terry_VB says:
me, too
Terry_VB says:
working on my business plan, actually
Mike says:
Looking for streetcard pictures.
Mike says:
streetcar
Terry_VB says:
*nods*
Mike says:
phone
Terry_VB says:
I have climbed the highest mountain.  
I have sailed across the sea
I have wrestled with my demons and woke up with only me
I have been around the block three times maybe four
But I think I deserve just a little more
Terry_VB says:
In front of total strangers, won't you kiss me?
Terry_VB says:
Flowers for no reason but you miss me
Terry_VB says:
Oh, I want to be in love
I wanna be in love
Standing on the doorstep in the rain
Cause you couldn't wait to see me once again
I want to be in love
Terry_VB says:
I have made some big mistakes
And I paid a heavy price
But I found a little peace between will & sacrifice
I have watched as all my dreams went walking out the door
And I think I deserve just a little more
Terry_VB says:
I'm looking for a heart of gold
I'm looking for a hand to hold
A Happy and strong and kind
Somewhere to rest my troubled mind
Terry_VB says:
In front of total strangers, would you kiss me?
Flowers for no reason but you missed me
Oh, I want to be in love
Terry_VB says:
On Tuesday night the candles and the wine
Wednesday morning, I wont' get to work on time
Oh, I want to be in love
I want to be in love

Surprise me as I'm stepping off the plane
Take my hand as they play our song again
Oh, I want to be in love
I want.. to be in love
Mike says:
This may take me a minute to sing back to myself...
Terry_VB says:
    take all the time you need
Mike says:
I'm sure I've heard this, but I can't bring the tune to mind.
Terry_VB says:
it's Melissa Etheridge's "I want to be in love"
Terry_VB says:
It just really sums up what I want
Terry_VB says:
except the flowers part
Mike says:
Okay, so I guess I don't know the tune.  You don't want flowers?
Terry_VB says:
naw
Terry_VB says:
they just die
Terry_VB says:
give me cash
Terry_VB says:
it lasts longer
Terry_VB says:
lol
Mike says:
Cash isn't as good for the soul.
Terry_VB says:
ok, take me to a movie vs. flowers
Terry_VB says:
buy me dinner vs. flowers
Terry_VB says:
make mad passionate love to me for hours vs. flowers
Terry_VB says:
ya get my point?
Mike says:
What about taking you to "War of the Roses," or finding a dish with cauliflower?  The last one is a no brainer.
Mike says:
I get your point, but flowers are nice.
Terry_VB says:
sorry, was on the phone
Terry_VB says:
ok, duly noted
Terry_VB says:
Flowers for you
Terry_VB says:
hot, sweaty sex for me
Mike says:
Well, it doesn't have to be either / or
Terry_VB says:
LOL
Terry_VB says:
I would hope NOT
Terry_VB says:
I was thinking cause/effect
Terry_VB says:
flowers for you = hot sweaty sex for me
Mike says:
Who knows...
Terry_VB says:
We do
Mike says:
Well, we hope.
Terry_VB says:
no hope
Terry_VB says:
we will know when we need to
Mike says:
Hope, then know.
Terry_VB says:
I know I am anxious to find out
Mike says:
Chez harrison awaits your three hour drive.
Terry_VB says:
oh?
Terry_VB says:
I had wondered if the mutual interest was there
Mike says:
I'm always leary in situations when I haven't met the other person face to face yet.
Terry_VB says:
and understandably so
Terry_VB says:
BUT
Terry_VB says:
have those people put themselves out there as much as I have?
Mike says:
On occation, although perhaps not quite as much.
Mike says:
Still, that's the way I am.
Terry_VB says:
and it's for a reason
Terry_VB says:
burn me once, shame on you. burn me twice, shame on me
Mike says:
I don't like being burned.
Terry_VB says:
ME, EITHER
Terry_VB says:
But, the soul would have no rainbow if the eyes had no tears
Mike says:
Similar to something I said earlier.
Terry_VB says:
A friend in Richmond gave me that a year ago when I got fired from GEICO
Terry_VB says:
It's a Native American Proverb
Mike says:
Speaking of proverbs and nonsequiters, I have to go to a meeting.
Terry_VB says:
ok dude
Mike says:
Enjoy your evening, Terry.
Terry_VB says:
are you coming back?
Mike says:
Might be after 5.
Terry_VB says:
ok.  Good deal
Terry_VB says:
but then you gotta go home
Mike says:
I do indeed.
Terry_VB says:
gosh, how could we communicate without computers?
Terry_VB says:
Oh yes... cell phones  
Mike says:
Carrier pigeons.
Terry_VB says:
those things poop ALL over the place
Terry_VB says:
not worth your $$
Mike says:
Just seeking alternatives.
Terry_VB says:
as we always should.  Well, have a nice time at your meeting
Terry_VB says:
we'll speak again soon
Mike says:
Thanks.  Talk to you later.
