Terry_VB says:
Hey Mike
Mike says:
Well, hello there.
Mike says:
How are you?
Terry_VB says:
Just peachy... more importantly, how are you?
Mike says:
Doing better all the time.
Mike says:
Work is great.
Mike says:
Personal life has taken a necessary turn.
Terry_VB says:
I am glad to hear that
Terry_VB says:
I knew you'd do it eventually
Mike says:
Do what?  Take pride in my work?   
Terry_VB says:
hehehe, that, too
Mike says:
No, things just weren't working well.
Terry_VB says:
You can't say you didn't try
Terry_VB says:
because God knows you've done your share of waiting and seeing
Mike says:
He's not happy about it, and I wish it had worked, but I don't want to wait around anymore.
Terry_VB says:
You've got to be true to yourself
Mike says:
Yes, that is true.  My other friends tell me that too.
Mike says:
Yes, I know.  But I've very patient.
Terry_VB says:
You are a very compassionate man, and I admire that... but your only job is to be true to yourself... I'm just glad to know you are doing a better job of that now
Mike says:
I am trying.
Terry_VB says:
   That's all you can do
Mike says:
I know what I need and feel long before I will act on those bits of knowledge, I must admit.
Terry_VB says:
I know you do
Terry_VB says:
You put others feelings first
Mike says:
As my mother says, I'm just too nice.
Mike says:
I just don't like to hurt other people's feelings.
Terry_VB says:
There is nothing wrong with having that outlook, as long as you don't hurt yourself in the process
Mike says:
Well, I'm less good at that second part there.
Terry_VB says:
I know.  We all have to work on that
Terry_VB says:
especially us nice guys
Mike says:
Yeah, I try to avoid the not so nice ones.  But what about you?--work, family, health, boys?
Terry_VB says:
Did you get my email after the hurricane?
Mike says:
Yes, I thing I got that one.
Terry_VB says:
ok, did I send you an email since my first poem got published?
Mike says:
Yes, I got that announcement.
Mike says:
That's great, which I'm sure I haven't said before.
Terry_VB says:
It's ok.  I knew you thought it.
Terry_VB says:
I always love to hear it, though
Mike says:
It's great to get published.
Terry_VB says:
as many compliments as I get on my poetry, you would be surprised at how insecure I am still in my talent
Terry_VB says:
I've written a total of 24 poems now, 8 of them in the last month
Mike says:
Creative stuff is very personal.  Sharing the results is not unlike braving a nudist beach.
Terry_VB says:
yeah, you're very right
Terry_VB says:
I do feel so vulnerable when I let someone read them
Mike says:
Exactly.
Mike says:
Unless you're writing epic poems, they have to have some personal angle to them.
Terry_VB says:
most of them.  
Terry_VB says:
I am going to send you these so you can tell me what you think
Mike says:
I'll have to look for my art critic's hat in the closet somewhere, you realize.
Mike says:
Just joking
Terry_VB says:
Eh, you don't have to critique them, you can just give me the "they're good" canned response
Terry_VB says:
I have heard some of them are DEEP
Mike says:
"They're really, really good."
Terry_VB says:
lol
Mike says:
And quit deep.
Terry_VB says:
It's hard to quit deep when I'm feeling deep
Mike says:
Quite.
Terry_VB says:
I finally wrote a poem expressing my feelings about HIV
Mike says:
Ah
Terry_VB says:
It's the one called "Three Scarlet Letters"
Mike says:
I'll look for it.
Terry_VB says:
as for the other facets of my life... I'm still single, going to Durham, NC on Thursday for 3 weeks to open a new PF Chang's
Terry_VB says:
my health is ok.  I've had little bouts with infections, but nothing major
Mike says:
Oh, nice.
Mike says:
(the work bit, not the single bit)
Terry_VB says:
I'm terminally single
Mike says:
Right, when you meet the guy, that will terminate you're being single.
Terry_VB says:
I met my ideal man last month
Mike says:
Oo.
Mike says:
Yes?
Terry_VB says:
but just like everything else in my life, there was an ironic twist
Mike says:
He was really a woman in disguise.
Terry_VB says:
naw
Terry_VB says:
I had always feared in my pursuit of finding that man who was always in my dreams, I would become HIV, THEN meet him, only for him to be HIV-... and of course, I did...  But that's not the only twist.  He is from Italy and was teaching at Duke University for a year... but got downsized, and now is leaving to go back to Italy December 1
Mike says:
And the irony is that you'll have to give up your pf chang's career to move to Italy, right?
Terry_VB says:
lol
Mike says:
No, seriously, I see what you mean.
Terry_VB says:
but who knows what the future holds
Mike says:
NOt I.
Terry_VB says:
I just know that it was SO hard having to tell him
Mike says:
How did he take it?
Terry_VB says:
better than me
Mike says:
Very nice.
Mike says:
It is hard to tell people these things.
Terry_VB says:
yup.  very
Mike says:
Everyone I know in the situation says that.
Terry_VB says:
It's the fear of rejection
Mike says:
Natural enough.
Mike says:
But of course you have to be honest, and the guy's reaction is going to be a window into his character.
Terry_VB says:
you're right
Mike says:
So, Mr. Italy?
Terry_VB says:
you wanna see his picture?
Mike says:
Yeah.
Terry_VB sends:
 
 
  
  Transfer of "DSC01314.JPG" is complete.
  
Mike says:
He's cute.
Terry_VB says:
He inspired a poem the day I met him, too... it's the one titled "My Perfect, Ideal Date"
Mike says:
You'd thought it was February 2, but then you realized it was this guy...
Terry_VB says:
do what?
Mike says:
You said "date"
Terry_VB says:
yup
Terry_VB says:
I just don't get the Feb 2 part
Mike says:
You thought your ideal date was the second of February, but it was really this cute man.
Terry_VB says:
lol, sorry, I'm slow 
Mike says:
Not my best play on words.
Terry_VB says:
I just woke up, so I'm not as mentally awake as normal
Mike says:
I'm about to go to bed, so me neither.
Terry_VB says:
yeah, it is your bedtime
Mike says:
So, he's taken the news okay?
Terry_VB says:
he's still talking to me, but I don't believe he wants anything more than my friendship
Terry_VB says:
but that's ok
Mike says:
Hmm.
Terry_VB says:
I've been single almost 4 years, another 4 won't hurt me
Mike says:
What happens at the end of the next four?
Terry_VB says:
I'm sure I can renew my single contract 
Terry_VB says:
I have connections
Mike says:
I was finding that rather difficult just recently.
Mike says:
But I see now that it is possible.
Terry_VB says:
I wish I could've helped you get through it... but I trust your other friends did a good job of it
Mike says:
Thanks.
Mike says:
yes, they did lots of listening, and much talking.
Mike says:
"Not this again" was a frequent refrain.
Mike says:
No, not really.
Terry_VB says:
You heard that probably because you were thinking it yourself
Mike says:
Yes, I was projecting it onto others.
Terry_VB says:
*nods*
Terry_VB says:
but Mike, you did it when it felt right
Terry_VB says:
and you didn't make a mistake
Mike says:
Well, yes.
Mike says:
I hope.
Terry_VB says:
Trust me
Terry_VB says:
One day you'll see
Mike says:
I feel it was the right thing.
Mike says:
And I'm not obcession about it anymore.
Mike says:
obcessing
Terry_VB says:
obsessing
Mike says:
Yes, yes that's it
Terry_VB says:
Good ol' spellcheck Terry
Mike says:
I've never claimed to be able to spell.
Terry_VB says:
lol
Terry_VB says:
Good thing, huh?
Mike says:
Yes.
Mike says:
But I do believe in good copy editing.
Terry_VB says:
I do, too
Terry_VB says:
Let me ask you one question, though.... when you think about the entire parameter of emotions that you feel regarding your past relationship.... do you feel happy now about where you are?
Mike says:
I'm disappointed that I haven't formed emotionally-enriching relationships my last two bfs, but I feel that I do know how to do that.  And everything else I feel good about, so, yes.
Terry_VB says:
Ok, that's focusing on what you didn't like about the relationships... Your job is play them all over again in your mind until you can come up with more good than bad that came out of it
Terry_VB says:
Look at what you learned about yourself
Terry_VB says:
what you helped him learn about himself
Terry_VB says:
Things that would have never happened had the relationship not existed
Mike says:
I'm still hoping I helped him learn things about myself, but that's now out of my hands, of course.
Mike says:
But yes, you are correct, let us focus on the positive.
Mike says:
My previous bf helped me to push some boundaries I'd thought of pushing but hadn't; I discovered I was mostly happy with where those boundaries where,
Terry_VB says:
Don't suppress your negative thoughts/emotions, just don't dwell on them.
Mike says:
but I know feel good about knowing that from
Mike says:
personal experience.
Mike says:
I'm not sure yet what I've gotten out of this last relationship.
Terry_VB says:
In time you'll see the reasons why it wasn't a mistake
Mike says:
No, I already don't think it was.
Terry_VB says:
well, I mean you'll find the things you've learned
Terry_VB says:
how you've grown
Terry_VB says:
because you did
Mike says:
Yes.
Terry_VB says:
if you hadn't, you wouldn't have left the relationship
Mike says:
yeah, the time wouldn't have been right.
Terry_VB says:
you are right
Terry_VB says:
ooops, I forgot to send that email
Mike says:
Not anymore.
Terry_VB says:
well Mike, if it's any consolation, you shouldn't be single for long
Terry_VB says:
and I say that with even more assurance now that I've met you in person
Mike says:
No, I'm really very dull and boring in person.
Terry_VB says:
you have so much good energy
Mike says:
Introverted. Awkward.
Mike says:
Pessimistic.
Terry_VB says:
ah, but you are talented
Mike says:
A real downer.
Mike says:
 
Terry_VB says:
Incredibly smart
Terry_VB says:
Good looking
Terry_VB says:
Wry sense of humor
Mike says:
Hmm.
Terry_VB says:
introverted, yes
Terry_VB says:
but that means you have depth
Terry_VB says:
and you know I could go on for hours
Terry_VB says:
I just can't believe I didn't figure out you were a Pisces
Mike says:
Thank you for your compliments.
Terry_VB says:
They're just my observations, Mike
Terry_VB says:
I promise you, if I didn't believe them, I certainly wouldn't say them
Mike says:
Thank you for your candid observations.
Terry_VB says:
I'm glad I could point them out to you
Mike says:
Well, while it isn't my goal to remain single, I am going to be more comfortable about being single than I sometimes have been.
Mike says:
The spell between the last two bfs wasn't very health for me (spiritually).
Terry_VB says:
Well, you've got me now
Terry_VB says:
I won't let you get down for long
Mike says:
And that has made all the difference.
Terry_VB says:
If you want my opinion, intuition, whatever you want to call it... you're going to be fine
Mike says:
Thank you.
Terry_VB says:
And on days when you're not feeling fine, I hope you'll reach out to someone, if you're ready to feel better
Mike says:
I've been doing pretty good with that.
Mike says:
I do require a lot of alone time, but I do call my friends for "pointless" get togethers, and I always feel better for it.
Terry_VB says:
well, I'm sure you make them feel better in the process, too
Terry_VB says:
Your energy is like a spiritual bandaid for me
Mike says:
I'm just out here being myself.
Terry_VB says:
and that's when you do it best
Terry_VB says:
that's HOW you do it best
Mike says:
 
Terry_VB says:
btw, I will do you a favor... when I talk to my friend Joseph (from DC) and he asks about you (which he does everytime we talk), I won't tell him you're single.  He had the hots for you and I know he'd show up in the museum and want to talk
Terry_VB says:
He is as persistent as a bull
Mike says:
My, that's a hefty favor.  But thank you.
Terry_VB says:
it's the least I can do
Terry_VB says:
=)~
Mike says:
Thankyou very sincerely.
Mike says:
Now I just have to keep my northern irish friend from jetting over when he hears I'm single.  He was quite a crush.
Terry_VB says:
He had a crush on you or you him?
Mike says:
He has, has.
Mike says:
He's very nice.
Terry_VB says:
it's easy to have a crush on you
Mike says:
And I've done my best not to encourage him.
Mike says:
 
Terry_VB says:
surely you know that
Mike says:
Yes, I do.
Terry_VB says:
so how long have you been single?
Mike says:
2-4 weeks, depending which conversation one starts the accounting from.
Terry_VB says:
*nods*
Mike says:
I haven't seen him since the second week in Oct.
Terry_VB says:
I knew something was going on with you
Terry_VB says:
You kept popping in my head
Terry_VB says:
but you hadn't replied to my last email
Terry_VB says:
so I knew you were busy
Mike says:
Very.
Terry_VB says:
Oct was a very busy month for me, too
Terry_VB says:
This whole year has been
Terry_VB says:
but I'm still here
Mike says:
And you'll still be here next year, being a positive light to all your friends.
Terry_VB says:
I hope so
Mike says:
No doubt of it.
Terry_VB says:
I try to be a positive light 
Terry_VB says:
It's not easy
Mike says:
Only your optimism shows.
Terry_VB says:
That's because that's all I allow most people to see
Terry_VB says:
 
Mike says:
No, it's also the more powerful trait.
Terry_VB says:
yeah, it's ingrained
Terry_VB says:
but you know, if you ever need a lift, you can call me
Mike says:
Thanks.
Terry_VB says:
There's no greater compliment you can give me than to ask me for help
Mike says:
I need to remember that more often.
Mike says:
I did really appreciate when you stopped by the museum.
Mike says:
I know I said that before.
Terry_VB says:
You made my whole trip
Mike says:
You're very charming in person.
Terry_VB says:
And in honesty, I was more excited about meeting you than the guy I was going to meet
Mike says:
My.
Mike says:
I was glad we could meet.
Terry_VB says:
Yeah, me too
Mike says:
(Which isn't to say that you're companions seemed that bad...)
Terry_VB says:
After I met you and toured the monuments, I was so glad to be going home
Mike says:
I've felt that way after some trips too.
Terry_VB says:
well, I just felt like I had experienced what I needed to... there was nothing else keeping me there
Mike says:
Once you're seen the monuments and met DC's most famous resident, what more is there?
Mike says:
(I suppose I should stop joking once in a while...)
Terry_VB says:
nothing I was interested in, obviously
Terry_VB says:
naw, comedy is therapeutic
Terry_VB says:
I love your bantor
Terry_VB says:
especially when you have to explain it to me
Mike says:
I try to avoid one's I have to explain.
Mike says:
No, actually, sometimes I don't avoid them.
Terry_VB says:
It's just your mental level is so much higher than most
Mike says:
My brain just makes funny connections sometimes.
Terry_VB says:
mine, too
Terry_VB says:
not everyone gets my humor, either
Terry_VB says:
I can't imagine how, but they don't
Mike says:
Well, humor isn't just for the audience.
Terry_VB says:
you're absolutely right
Terry_VB says:
as long as I laugh, I don't care
Mike says:
On that note, should I head off to bed?
Terry_VB says:
as much as I hate to let you go, I know it's past your bedtime
Mike says:
yes, and I have a long day tomorrow.
Mike says:
I'm glad you're doing well.
Mike says:
And glad to get caught up.
Terry_VB says:
I'm glad we could catch up, too
Terry_VB says:
I wish we talked more often
Terry_VB says:
Seriously, take me up on the phone call offer
Mike says:
I'm not online too much.
Mike says:
Okay.
Terry_VB says:
or email me
Terry_VB says:
use the terryholliday@cox.net email addy b/c i don't check the hotmail account
Terry_VB says:
but I'd much rather hear your voice
Mike says:
Okay.
Mike says:
I'll see what I can do.
Terry_VB says:
You'll do your best
Terry_VB says:
   
Mike says:
I try.
Mike says:
Have fun in N.C.
Terry_VB says:
I will
Terry_VB says:
I'm so excited
Terry_VB says:
I'll be busy, but I'll keep in touch
Mike says:
Sounds good.
Terry_VB says:
and my phone works down there
Mike says:
Right, of course.You have a good night.
Mike says:
Okay?
Terry_VB says:
g'nite Mike
Terry_VB says:
Sweet dreams
Mike says:
