"7/5/97 9:45:01 PM","Terry 20 yrs old Single GWM","Are you there?"
"7/5/97 9:45:11 PM","Young Guy","some would put the meaning as wanting every thing for one's self and not really caring for others  and hurting their hearts....one...must not just look in a book...on this word"
"7/5/97 9:45:50 PM","Terry 20 yrs old Single GWM","Sorry, I just wanted to tell you the definition of selfless"
"7/5/97 9:46:12 PM","Young Guy","it is one to decide this meaning when dealing with humans"

"7/5/97 9:53:54 PM","Terry 20 yrs old Single GWM","You know... Everything happens for a reason"
"7/5/97 9:54:03 PM","Terry 20 yrs old Single GWM","God doesn't close one door without opening another"
"7/5/97 9:55:02 PM","Young Guy","So God plans these things...who I am I too question it....but...not be break one's heart...i must let this person know where i and he stands for now Friend"
"7/5/97 9:55:10 PM","Terry 20 yrs old Single GWM","Could it be that the only reason that you even opened your heart to this guy was that you were afraid that Kevin would not be true to you and that you would be left alone? Even though you really wouldn't be... Just a thought?"
"7/5/97 9:55:47 PM","Young Guy","No in my heart i cant' say that"
"7/5/97 9:56:01 PM","Young Guy","he is just wonderful"

"7/5/97 9:56:19 PM","Young Guy","we just have to much in common...i suppose"
"7/5/97 9:56:22 PM","Terry 20 yrs old Single GWM","Maybe Kevin moved for a reason... Unknown to you or him"
"7/5/97 9:56:33 PM","Terry 20 yrs old Single GWM","Maybe God has other plans for the two of you"
"7/5/97 9:56:46 PM","Young Guy","just he wants a full heart and mine is unable to be given fully at this time"
"7/5/97 9:57:07 PM","Terry 20 yrs old Single GWM","If he truly wants your heart at all, he'll take what he can get."
"7/5/97 9:57:20 PM","Terry 20 yrs old Single GWM","I'm sure he's just sad because he really cares for you"
"7/5/97 9:57:48 PM","Terry 20 yrs old Single GWM","But this guy seems to be very understanding"
"7/5/97 9:57:56 PM","Terry 20 yrs old Single GWM","I'm sure it will all work out for the best"
"7/5/97 9:58:17 PM","Terry 20 yrs old Single GWM","You've got to just look at it like this: if it's meant to be, it'll happen, if it's not, it won't"

"7/5/97 10:00:43 PM","Young Guy","this is not hope"
"7/5/97 10:00:50 PM","Terry 20 yrs old Single GWM","I'm sure he will"
"7/5/97 10:01:00 PM","Terry 20 yrs old Single GWM","But there's nothing you can do about it"
"7/5/97 10:01:17 PM","Terry 20 yrs old Single GWM","He's got to be the one to make the decisions that affect his life"
"7/5/97 10:01:32 PM","Terry 20 yrs old Single GWM","He's got to be the one to make the move to find someone"
"7/5/97 10:01:48 PM","Terry 20 yrs old Single GWM","Your hands are really tied, my friend"
