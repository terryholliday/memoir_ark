Kllr1964 (8:26:23 AM): 
we're not bad peaple
VBTerry24 (8:26:42 AM): Love Match
Virgo and Cancer
When Cancer and Virgo come together, it creates a strong and down-to-earth relationship that will only grow stronger with 
time. Both Signs are goal-oriented and disciplined. Cancer and Virgo are sincere and devoted to each other, and both have a 
strong sense of purpose. They admire each other: Virgo respects Cancer's quiet strength and dedication while Cancer 
appreciates Virgo's ability to adapt to a given situation. 
VBTerry24 (8:27:04 AM): This is a relationship that may take time to develop, but it will get stronger. The Cancer-Virgo duo is 
based on common sense and strong principles. These partners can be materialistic, as they both enjoy the little comforts in life 
and in the home, but they are willing to work hard to succeed. Difficulties can arise if Virgo is too critical for Cancer's 
easily-bruised feelings; Cancer needs to understand that this is Virgo's nature and not a personal attack. Virgo might dislike 
Cancer's stubborn streak, but can learn to be patient and understanding of the Crab's nature. Additionally, Virgo enjoys 
indulging Cancer -- the Virgo commitment to service combines well with Cancer's love of nurturing, thus pleasing both partners. 
VBTerry24 (8:27:16 AM): Cancer is ruled by the Moon and Virgo is ruled by Mercury. Both of these Planets are close to the 
Sun, so they're always in the same neighborhood even though they are very different. The Moon is matriarchal; it's about 
cultivation and nurturing, both of which are important to Cancer. Mercury is communication, and it's androgynous -- Virgo will 
take on the form that it chooses. Virgo has a more intellectual approach, but is adept at figuring out other people. Because of 
this, Virgo can quickly understand and become the devoted and the domestic partner that Cancer loves, and they won't argue 
about fulfilling each other's needs.
VBTerry24 (8:27:31 AM): Cancer is a Water Sign and Virgo is an Earth Sign. Earth Signs are about possessions, and the 
Cancer-Virgo partners usually surround themselves with comfortable, well-crafted things. The Water Sign relies on emotion 
and intuition, making Cancer the fueling force behind the relationship in a quiet way. Along with their desire to be prosperous, 
their love of a fancy home life ensures that this couple will work hard toward this shared goal. Additionally, they are a practical 
pair, and they rarely have problems caused by one partner's lack of control. 
VBTerry24 (8:27:40 AM): Cancer is a Cardinal Sign and Virgo is a Mutable Sign. While Cancer tends to implement new ideas, 
Virgo likes to move from project to project as the feeling takes them. Because of their ubiquitous nature, it's easy for Virgo to 
find a place in Cancer's plans. Virgo can remember Cancer's plans, and eventually will make them produce something even if 
Cancer has moved on.
VBTerry24 (8:27:47 AM): The best aspect of the Cancer-Virgo relationship is their dedication to working towards the same 
goals. Both partners enjoy a stable home life and nice things, and Virgo likes helping Cancer achieve their goals. Their mutual 
interests make theirs a highly compatible relationship.
VBTerry24 (8:29:44 AM): Isn't that neat?
Kllr1964 (8:29:55 AM): i would! i would do anything to keep you out of those bad moods
Kllr1964 (8:30:05 AM): yeah that is neat
