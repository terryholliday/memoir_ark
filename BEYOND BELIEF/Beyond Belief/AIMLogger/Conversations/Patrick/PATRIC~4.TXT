"10/23/97 12:02:04 AM","Patrick A.","Are you certain they are malignant?"
"10/23/97 12:02:17 AM","Charming & Handsome","Unless the doctor just wanted to scare me"

"10/23/97 12:03:10 AM","Patrick A.","O''kay smart ass, did he say what kind of malignancy"
"10/23/97 12:03:12 AM","Charming & Handsome","They''re only in stage 1"
"10/23/97 12:03:34 AM","Charming & Handsome","So it''s not a high-priority to remove them, but they do want to remove them before they progress"
"10/23/97 12:03:42 AM","Patrick A.","I understand stages, but did he say what kind of malignancy"
"10/23/97 12:04:01 AM","Patrick A.","Did he give the carcenoma a name?"
"10/23/97 12:04:07 AM","Charming & Handsome","Yeah, but I don''t remember. I don''t worry about it"

"10/23/97 12:05:02 AM","Charming & Handsome","Can we talk about something else, please"
"10/23/97 12:05:05 AM","Patrick A.","Its a good policy not to worry about it, but still listen to what he says, . Those areas you said were tumorous, are lymph node areas, are they affected?"
"10/23/97 12:05:32 AM","Charming & Handsome","My doctor doesn''t seem too scared"
"10/23/97 12:05:44 AM","Charming & Handsome","otherwise he''d have made me get them removed when he found them"
"10/23/97 12:06:24 AM","Charming & Handsome","But I''d rather not talk about it. The less I think about it, the less I''ll have to worry"
"10/23/97 12:06:36 AM","Charming & Handsome","And believe me, I worry enough as it is."
"10/23/97 12:06:39 AM","Patrick A.","Excellent, you know T even though I have only known you for two weeks I still love you, and it is not a sexual love because I don''t know you that way, it is a personal love, I have only known you by personality"
"10/23/97 12:07:03 AM","Charming & Handsome","Well, that''s good to know"
"10/23/97 12:07:13 AM","Charming & Handsome","I certainly appreciate it"
"10/23/97 12:07:34 AM","Patrick A.","I am also a religious person, and I will keep you in my prayers"
"10/23/97 12:07:52 AM","Charming & Handsome","I did pray for your friend the other night"
"10/23/97 12:08:32 AM","Patrick A.","T I promise never to mention this again unless you decide to bring it up. I have had cancer experience in my family and I also have medical doctors in my family that can provide advice if you need it"
"10/23/97 12:08:49 AM","Charming & Handsome","Well, I appreciate that, I really do"
"10/23/97 12:09:16 AM","Charming & Handsome","But I have been going to this doctor since I was 4 and I trust him with my whole heart and know that he wouldn''t let anything bad happen to me"
"10/23/97 12:10:04 AM","Patrick A.","I will only say one thing and it is important. ALWAYS SEEK THE ADVICE OF AN EXPERT IN THE FIELD NEVER TRUST JUST BECAUSE THAT PERSON IS AN M.D. THEY ARE ALL KNOWING, RELY ON SPECIALISTS"
"10/23/97 12:10:16 AM","Charming & Handsome","I know"
"10/23/97 12:10:20 AM","Patrick A.","PLEASE"
"10/23/97 12:10:26 AM","Charming & Handsome","OK"

"10/23/97 12:11:30 AM","Patrick A.","Why are you keeping it from them T?"
"10/23/97 12:11:32 AM","Charming & Handsome","They haven''t caught on to why I keep going to the doctor so much"
"10/23/97 12:11:45 AM","Charming & Handsome","My work has asked if anything is wrong, though"
"10/23/97 12:11:54 AM","Patrick A.","Why are you keeping it from them?"
"10/23/97 12:11:57 AM","Charming & Handsome","Everyone acts differently when you tell them "
"10/23/97 12:12:05 AM","Charming & Handsome","I have kept it to myself"
"10/23/97 12:12:12 AM","Charming & Handsome","I like to bottle stuff up inside"
"10/23/97 12:12:24 AM","Charming & Handsome","That''s why I break down inside"
"10/23/97 12:12:39 AM","Charming & Handsome","But I always rebuild, and am always stronger in the end"
"10/23/97 12:12:53 AM","Patrick A.","T, if this gets serious, family support is essential, plus you are obviously burdened by it, you need to share the burden"
"10/23/97 12:13:06 AM","Charming & Handsome","DON''T WORRY! MOM!"
"10/23/97 12:13:19 AM","Patrick A.","THATS WHAT FAMILIES ARE FOR"
"10/23/97 12:13:41 AM","Charming & Handsome","Geesh, if I had known you were gonna be like this, I wouldn''t have told you"
"10/23/97 12:13:52 AM","Charming & Handsome","This is exactly why I don''t tell them"
"10/23/97 12:13:55 AM","Patrick A.","What would you do?"
"10/23/97 12:14:14 AM","Charming & Handsome","I''m sorry??"
"10/23/97 12:14:18 AM","Patrick A.","Terry I will be here for you"
"10/23/97 12:14:27 AM","Patrick A.","Smart Ass"
"10/23/97 12:14:39 AM","Charming & Handsome","What did you mean by "What would you do?"?"
"10/23/97 12:14:43 AM","Patrick A.","Who all knows?"
