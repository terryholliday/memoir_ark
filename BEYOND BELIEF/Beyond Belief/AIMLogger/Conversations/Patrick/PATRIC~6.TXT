"11/4/97 1:11:05 AM","Charming & Handsome","and then you''d move to Texas"
"11/4/97 1:11:09 AM","Charming & Handsome","and then my heart would break"
"11/4/97 1:11:18 AM","Charming & Handsome","and then I''d be distrusting of people for a while"
"11/4/97 1:11:28 AM","Patrick A","I didn''t say i was moving to Texas, that is the headquarters for the company"
"11/4/97 1:11:42 AM","Charming & Handsome","You''ve got to tell me this information"

"11/4/97 1:17:35 AM","Patrick A","Hey I had some investments in the market when it went boom boom!!!"
"11/4/97 1:17:49 AM","Charming & Handsome","It went boom boom?"
