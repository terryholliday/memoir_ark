"10/23/97 3:26:49 AM","Patrick A.","probably not, your right but from what I know I guess I do, does that make any sense?"
"10/23/97 3:27:02 AM","Charming & Handsome","Whenever someone starts to get close to me, I distance myself from them"
"10/23/97 3:27:16 AM","Charming & Handsome","It''s my mechanism from getting hurt"
"10/23/97 3:27:20 AM","Patrick A.","So do I, so i guess that is a tough one huh?"
"10/23/97 3:27:37 AM","Charming & Handsome","That''s why you''re probably noticing a difference in my attitude"
"10/23/97 3:27:45 AM","Patrick A.","no doubt"
"10/23/97 3:28:02 AM","Charming & Handsome","Getting hurt is no fun"
"10/23/97 3:28:03 AM","Patrick A.","do you think I am setting you up for a fall?"
"10/23/97 3:28:12 AM","Charming & Handsome","No, you''re not"
"10/23/97 3:28:19 AM","Charming & Handsome","I would be setting myself up for a fall"
"10/23/97 3:28:56 AM","Patrick A.","Terry that is definately not my nature believe me I am probably more careful than you are or at least every bit as careful"
"10/23/97 3:29:23 AM","Charming & Handsome","I am not careful, as you''ve probably gathered from my stories"
"10/23/97 3:29:36 AM","Patrick A.","You are risky"
"10/23/97 3:29:45 AM","Charming & Handsome","And THAT is why I get hurt"
"10/23/97 3:29:59 AM","Patrick A.","You have to watch the S.T.D.''s in this day and age"
"10/23/97 3:30:07 AM","Charming & Handsome","Oh, I''m careful"

"10/23/97 3:30:52 AM","Charming & Handsome","Although if you were my lover, I would not want to use condoms all the time"
"10/23/97 3:30:59 AM","Charming & Handsome","and I depise the word lover"
"10/23/97 3:31:12 AM","Patrick A.","I think a lot of the reason why you get yourself hurt alot is that you set yourself up for it"
"10/23/97 3:31:29 AM","Charming & Handsome","And you''re probably right"
"10/23/97 3:31:31 AM","Charming & Handsome","I know you are"
"10/23/97 3:32:03 AM","Patrick A.","terry believe this I have only had one sexual encounter with a man"

"10/23/97 3:32:35 AM","Patrick A.","I have had several with women, and some seriously but I lean towards men"
"10/23/97 3:33:05 AM","Charming & Handsome","I would hope so, otherwise I''m wasting my time"
"10/23/97 3:33:25 AM","Patrick A.","Still I amvery careful"

"10/23/97 3:35:14 AM","Charming & Handsome","You not into young alter boys?"
"10/23/97 3:35:24 AM","Patrick A.","because, that is a true commitment and one I didn''t feel comforatble with"
"10/23/97 3:35:39 AM","Patrick A.","No I am not into alter boys"
"10/23/97 3:35:53 AM","Charming & Handsome","Descibe for me your facial features"

"10/23/97 3:37:07 AM","Patrick A.","Jaw not too square but I don''t have a long face"
"10/23/97 3:37:26 AM","Charming & Handsome","All jokes aside, if we were to become serious, what would you do?"
"10/23/97 3:37:35 AM","Patrick A.","I do not have facial hair, I think i could grow a beard or mustache but do not desire to"

"10/23/97 3:40:22 AM","Charming & Handsome","If we became seriously involved, what would we do? Not sexually, either"
"10/23/97 3:40:44 AM","Patrick A.","I have very good teeth, if you were to send me to a vet he could tell you I am about 27 years old, I have absolutley never had any cavitites"
"10/23/97 3:41:29 AM","Patrick A.","i don''t know for sure Terry, I would have to figure that out as we went along"
"10/23/97 3:41:47 AM","Patrick A.","any ideas"
"10/23/97 3:41:58 AM","Charming & Handsome","No, I just wanted to get a feel of what you thought"
"10/23/97 3:42:12 AM","Charming & Handsome","Because I know pretty sure that I would end up having to move to Erie"
"10/23/97 3:42:20 AM","Patrick A.","this is peculiar situation for me"

"10/23/97 3:44:16 AM","Charming & Handsome","If neither of us plan on coming out, then that would be pretty hard to explain, don''t you think?"
"10/23/97 3:44:53 AM","Patrick A.","very hard, and i think it would be a tuff one, don''t know yet what to do there"
"10/23/97 3:45:11 AM","Patrick A.","hey ever 69?"

"10/23/97 3:53:22 AM","Patrick A.","yes kinky might just be sucking your balls"
"10/23/97 3:53:26 AM","Charming & Handsome","you asked me if I would let you undress me"
"10/23/97 3:53:34 AM","Patrick A.","and...."

"10/23/97 3:54:18 AM","Charming & Handsome","well, rarely nothing"
"10/23/97 3:54:19 AM","Patrick A.","that would definately be a major fantasy for me."
"10/23/97 3:54:43 AM","Charming & Handsome","It''s hard for me to understand why anyone would want me"
"10/23/97 3:54:51 AM","Charming & Handsome","that''s where my insecurity kicks in"
"10/23/97 3:54:59 AM","Patrick A.","IYou know I have opened up to you more than any one on the face of the earth?"
"10/23/97 3:55:06 AM","Charming & Handsome","Well, good"

"10/23/97 3:56:21 AM","Patrick A.","are you getting that feeling back again?"
"10/23/97 3:56:31 AM","Charming & Handsome","ho hmmm"
"10/23/97 3:56:46 AM","Charming & Handsome","YES"
"10/23/97 3:57:05 AM","Charming & Handsome","I''ll have to repress it tomorrow"
"10/23/97 3:57:21 AM","Patrick A.","Hey my desk chair is getting very warm, its either  you or I''m too close to the fire"
"10/23/97 3:57:30 AM","Charming & Handsome","It''s me"
"10/23/97 3:57:55 AM","Patrick A.","and the chair is leather too, its really getting HOT"
"10/23/97 3:57:59 AM","Charming & Handsome","You know, as much as you tell me that physical attributes don''t mean anything to you, you''re either lying to me, or lying to yourself"
"10/23/97 3:58:23 AM","Patrick A.","what do you mean?"
"10/23/97 3:58:24 AM","Charming & Handsome","Because no matter what people say, you have to find the other person physically attractive or there''s nothing there"
"10/23/97 3:58:59 AM","Charming & Handsome","For instance, if I was completely ugly and tremendously fat, you would not be able to fall in love with me"
"10/23/97 3:59:12 AM","Charming & Handsome","Even with the best personality in the world"
"10/23/97 3:59:27 AM","Patrick A.","I agree with that but one perosn''s idea of physical attraction may mean something else to some one else."
"10/23/97 3:59:35 AM","Charming & Handsome","I agree"
"10/23/97 3:59:50 AM","Charming & Handsome","I keep that same picture I gave to you on my desktop wall paper"
"10/23/97 3:59:55 AM","Patrick A.","My first true love was homely as a mud fence, and I could have dated a beauty queen"
"10/23/97 4:00:17 AM","Patrick A.","I think you are beautiful though"
"10/23/97 4:00:20 AM","Charming & Handsome","and some days I look at that picture and think, "God, I''m so ugly, why can''t I look like so and so""
"10/23/97 4:00:37 AM","Charming & Handsome","and others I can look at my picture and think I''m not that bad looking"
"10/23/97 4:00:54 AM","Patrick A.","No you are very handsome and have a charm in your eyes, do you have any other pictures?"
"10/23/97 4:00:58 AM","Charming & Handsome","See, that scares me when you tell me you think I''m beautiful"
"10/23/97 4:01:08 AM","Charming & Handsome","why?"
"10/23/97 4:01:23 AM","Charming & Handsome","because most of the people who are attracted to my looks I don''t find attractive"
"10/23/97 4:01:34 AM","Patrick A.","I would like to see other pictures, I think you are very very attractive"
"10/23/97 4:01:46 AM","Charming & Handsome","I would like for you to see other pictures of me also"
"10/23/97 4:01:48 AM","Charming & Handsome","but you''re not"
"10/23/97 4:02:13 AM","Patrick A.","You know Terry since we have met this the only time we have talked about our loks since that first night, so there"
"10/23/97 4:02:40 AM","Charming & Handsome","Do you remember what you told me when you saw my picture for the first time?"
"10/23/97 4:02:51 AM","Patrick A.","yes, I kidded you"
"10/23/97 4:02:57 AM","Charming & Handsome","what did you say?"
"10/23/97 4:03:04 AM","Patrick A.","wait..."
"10/23/97 4:03:07 AM","Charming & Handsome","There''s one word that I will always remember"
"10/23/97 4:03:16 AM","Patrick A.","I said you were an eight"
"10/23/97 4:03:25 AM","Charming & Handsome","no, you must''ve just thought that"
"10/23/97 4:03:30 AM","Charming & Handsome","but that''s good information to have"
"10/23/97 4:03:36 AM","Patrick A.","but I was kidding you were a ten"
"10/23/97 4:03:52 AM","Patrick A.","what was that one word?"
"10/23/97 4:03:53 AM","Charming & Handsome","keep flattering me, it''ll get you everywhere"
"10/23/97 4:04:06 AM","Patrick A.","hahahahahaha, what was the word?"
"10/23/97 4:04:09 AM","Charming & Handsome","After you saw it, you said, and I quote "You look studios""
"10/23/97 4:04:23 AM","Charming & Handsome","I take that back"
"10/23/97 4:04:27 AM","Patrick A.","You do? And I love you for it!!!!!"
"10/23/97 4:04:30 AM","Charming & Handsome","you told me I had a studios look on my face"
"10/23/97 4:04:51 AM","Patrick A.","A charming studious look."
"10/23/97 4:05:05 AM","Patrick A.","Do me a favor"
"10/23/97 4:05:16 AM","Charming & Handsome","My German friends gave me the name Charming & Handsome"
"10/23/97 4:05:19 AM","Charming & Handsome","yes, what is it?"
"10/23/97 4:05:37 AM","Patrick A.","Never, Never, Never, Never Change"
"10/23/97 4:05:56 AM","Charming & Handsome","If I didn''t know better, I''d swear you were trying to make me fall in love with you"
