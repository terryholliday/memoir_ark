"10/20/97 10:38:59 PM","Patrick A.","Oh shit, I''m a Roman Catholic, I''ve been told Baptists don''t much like Micks"
"10/20/97 10:39:07 PM","Charming & Handsome","Micks?"
"10/20/97 10:39:19 PM","Charming & Handsome","I knew you were Catholic, though"
"10/20/97 10:39:25 PM","Charming & Handsome","Just had a feeling"
"10/20/97 10:39:34 PM","Patrick A.","You know Irish Catholics, like McMichael, McWilliams etc..."
"10/20/97 10:39:51 PM","Charming & Handsome","I have an extra Catholic sensory perception"
"10/20/97 10:39:57 PM","Patrick A.","what do you mean?"
"10/20/97 10:40:05 PM","Charming & Handsome","Most of my family is Catholic"
"10/20/97 10:40:12 PM","Charming & Handsome","I can just tell when someone is Catholic"
"10/20/97 10:40:18 PM","Charming & Handsome","Dont'' know!"
"10/20/97 10:40:19 PM","Charming & Handsome","Just can"
"10/20/97 10:40:24 PM","Patrick A.","Yes I''m a fish eating Irish Catholic"
"10/20/97 10:40:29 PM","Charming & Handsome","That''s OK"
"10/20/97 10:40:33 PM","Charming & Handsome","most of my relatives are also"
"10/20/97 10:40:37 PM","Charming & Handsome","can''t say I agree with it"
"10/20/97 10:40:44 PM","Charming & Handsome","but at least you believe in God"
"10/20/97 10:40:56 PM","Charming & Handsome","so we don''t have to deal with that issue"
"10/20/97 10:41:02 PM","Patrick A.","Don''t have to, I don''t always either, its part of my heritage"
"10/20/97 10:41:21 PM","Charming & Handsome","you wanna know what I disagree with most?"
"10/20/97 10:41:22 PM","Patrick A.","oh yes I believe in GOD"
"10/20/97 10:41:31 PM","Patrick A.","what is that?"
"10/20/97 10:41:47 PM","Charming & Handsome","The fact that you guys believe in pergatory, confiding in priests and last rights"
"10/20/97 10:42:11 PM","Patrick A.","The Jews call it sleeping in Abraham''s bosom"
"10/20/97 10:42:32 PM","Charming & Handsome","When are you planning on meeting me?"
"10/20/97 10:42:43 PM","Patrick A.","Confession can be a good thing, its very theraputic, putting your sins into words and adressing them head on"
"10/20/97 10:43:16 PM","Patrick A.","I am going to get some dates tomorrow and then I''ll run it by you tomorrow night o''kay?"
"10/20/97 10:43:28 PM","Charming & Handsome","Well, confession to a priest and confession to God are two majorly different things, and I don''t think just because you tell a priest you''ve sinned and go say three hail mary''s everything is OK"
"10/20/97 10:43:45 PM","Charming & Handsome","but that may just be me"
"10/20/97 10:44:34 PM","Patrick A.","Well, there must be atonement for sins, but we are taught Jesus Christ is a forgiving God and he died on the CROSS to reslve and forgive our sins"
"10/20/97 10:44:59 PM","Charming & Handsome","Yes, that is true, but we should ask forgiveness of our sins from God, not a priest"
"10/20/97 10:45:09 PM","Patrick A.","So forgiveness should be easy for all Christians be they Ctaholic or Protestant"
"10/20/97 10:45:29 PM","Charming & Handsome","Confession I don''t disagree with as much as Pergatory"
"10/20/97 10:45:44 PM","Charming & Handsome","But you know, I always wanted to be Catholic"
"10/20/97 10:45:54 PM","Charming & Handsome","I always liked the rituals that they do"
"10/20/97 10:46:12 PM","Charming & Handsome",""God be with you my child" "And also with you, Father""
"10/20/97 10:46:25 PM","Patrick A.","Yes but according to the Petrine Doctrine Christ Said to Simon Peter, Simon Thou art Peter and uponTHIS rock I will build my church, As I do so shall you do also"
"10/20/97 10:47:08 PM","Charming & Handsome","I''m sure we could debate religion for many hours"
"10/20/97 10:47:15 PM","Charming & Handsome","but tonight is not going to be one of them"
"10/20/97 10:47:17 PM","Patrick A.","Therefore based on this doctrine, Christ tells us that the priest is continuing HIS work on earth"
"10/20/97 10:47:26 PM","Charming & Handsome","I love you Patrick"
"10/20/97 10:47:32 PM","Patrick A.","I love you too"
