        spotted you come in \par

Terry_VB: take a look around in here\par
pghoracle: awwww, thanks, not so bad urself\par
Terry_VB: thank you.  I don't just mean your looks, though you are quite striking. \par
        Your profile is very nice\par
pghoracle: ur a sweet talker, probably an air sign\par
pghoracle: LOL\par
Terry_VB: well, I do have a lot of air in my chart, but I am a Virgo\par
pghoracle: me too, sept 6\par
pghoracle: with alot of air too\par
Terry_VB: no wonder I liked your profile.  My b-day is Sept 5\par

Terry_VB: I've been studying it for the last year.  It's becoming a passion of mine\par
pghoracle: ive been interested in astrology since 18ish\par
Terry_VB: not me.  I was too skeptical\par
Terry_VB: but what good Virgo isn't?\par
pghoracle: me too, but I studied it to prove it or disprovei t\par
Terry_VB: well, that's basically why I started looking into it.  My Scorpio best friend \par
        Alison always used to say, "That's b/c he's a Gemini, etc."  And I was always \par
        like bullshit\par
Terry_VB: but then when I opened my eyes, it made sense\par
pghoracle: yeah, indepth practice shows alot more detail\par

Terry_VB: well, I think we just met a new best friend today\par
pghoracle: ?\par
Terry_VB: you and I\par
pghoracle: why do u say that?\par
Terry_VB: just a feeling\par
pghoracle: hmmm\par
pghoracle: the skeptical virgo will give the benefit of the doubt. :-)\par
Terry_VB: Well, only time will tell what we create.  But I certainly don't plan on losing \par
        touch with someone like you\par

        of the chart\par

Terry_VB: did you look at my chart?\par

Terry_VB: *nods*\par
Terry_VB: yeah, I will one day be a world leader \par

pghoracle: highly idealistic\par
pghoracle: neptune in first\par
Terry_VB: and I love to daydream\par
pghoracle: friendships big time\par
pghoracle: but very spontaneous\par
Terry_VB: yeah, my friendships have a very erratic pattern to them\par
Terry_VB: starting and stopping esp\par
Terry_VB: that's the Uranus in the 11th house\par
pghoracle: shock\par
pghoracle: LOL\par
Terry_VB: that I know that after only a year of study?\par
pghoracle: you are drawn to geminis\par
pghoracle: or smart communicative types\par
Terry_VB: those with Gemini characteristics.  I love someone who can debate with \par
        me\par
Terry_VB: intellectual stimulation is just as important to me as physical\par

Terry_VB: oh yes.  I am like a sponge\par
Terry_VB: I have always yearned for knowledge\par

pghoracle: and very bubbly\par
Terry_VB: Venus in Leo\par
pghoracle: sag rising too\par
Terry_VB: *nods*  \par
Terry_VB: look at how my Sun is square my Moon\par
Terry_VB: I am always at a cross purpose with myself.  Integrating those two \par
        energies has been one my biggest challenges\par
pghoracle: lost it, repunching it\par
pghoracle: must have closed it\par
Terry_VB: no worries\par
pghoracle: im not, just being dumb\par
Terry_VB: Do you know much about transits?\par
pghoracle: somewhat yeah\par
pghoracle: highly sexual\par
Terry_VB: yes, I am\par
pghoracle: but mars in water\par
pghoracle: stay focused dude\par
pghoracle: have a hard time staying on one thing at a time\par
Terry_VB: yup\par
Terry_VB: that is my Pisces influence.  My Sun is Square Neptune in the 1st house\par
Terry_VB: believe me, I try to focus\par
pghoracle: scorpio on the 12th\par
pghoracle: hmm\par
pghoracle: dont allow urself to become to heavily immersed in the additions of life\par
pghoracle: addictions\par
pghoracle: this is tied to relationships\par
pghoracle: friendships\par
Terry_VB: yup.  I have a highly addictive personality\par
pghoracle: stable home life?\par
Terry_VB: yeah\par
Terry_VB: My family lives in WV\par
pghoracle: is your father or mother the piscies?\par
Terry_VB: no, my mom is a Cancer with Gemini Rising, and my Dad is a Gemini, \par
        but I don't know what time he was born\par
pghoracle: hmmmmm\par
Terry_VB: I know.  the cusp of the 4th house usually indicates the mother\par
pghoracle: hmm, u have studied\par
Terry_VB: ;-)\par
pghoracle: one other thing\par
pghoracle: you aer intensely dedicated o the one u love\par
Terry_VB: yeah.  I am definitely a loyal partner\par
pghoracle: to the point of being slightly jealous\par
Terry_VB: not anymore.  maybe once upon a time\par
Terry_VB: but I love my freedom\par
pghoracle: good, maybe u have worked past it\par
Terry_VB: and can only have that freedom by giving it away\par
pghoracle: u have brown eyes?\par
Terry_VB: they're blue/green.  They actually change with my mood\par
pghoracle: sweet, black and white pic\par
pghoracle: I swear u remind me of my friend\par
pghoracle: hes just a tad older\par
Terry_VB: does he have a Sag rising?\par
pghoracle: 40\par
pghoracle: LOL\par
pghoracle: he is a SAG\par
pghoracle: LOL\par
Terry_VB: *nods*  well, that explains it\par
pghoracle: and to be honest, i belive he has sag rising too\par
pghoracle: LOL\par
pghoracle: he is a total flirt\par
pghoracle: or u can say whore\par
pghoracle: LOL\par
pghoracle: but he is a wonderful guy\par
Terry_VB: I am sure\par
Terry_VB: So how has Jupiter been treating you since your last birthday?\par
Terry_VB: do you feel yourself expanding in all different directions?\par
pghoracle: well I really feel like I am going through alot of changes\par
pghoracle: oh yeah big time\par
Terry_VB: you will most likely begin to feel those influences increase when Jupiter \par
        goes direct on May 5\par
pghoracle: for god sake, alot will be coming in JUNE, this I know\par
Terry_VB: have you changed jobs recently or feel a job change coming?\par
pghoracle: yep, graduating from school in June\par
pghoracle: LOL\par
Terry_VB: well, there ya go\par
pghoracle: so i am beginning to glance around\par
Terry_VB: what are you graduating with?\par
pghoracle: BS in Industrial Design\par
Terry_VB: interesting\par
pghoracle: product design, automotive, exhibit, environmental, furniture\par
pghoracle: very broad application\par
pghoracle: continue on bout my chart\par
pghoracle: been a long time for me\par
pghoracle: :-)\par
Terry_VB: do you want to know what your horoscope says for today?\par
pghoracle: sure\par
Terry_VB: Mars is in your 9th House\par
Terry_VB: from March until May\par
pghoracle: yeah\par
Terry_VB: better maximize this screen\par
pghoracle: k\par
Terry_VB: This can be a time when you do more creative intellectual work than \par
        usual and attempt to convey your experience and view of the world to others. \par
        You will assert and defend the beliefs and ideas that you consider true and \par
        important wherever necessary. Obviously this is valuable if you have to \par
        influence other people and make an impression on them, but it can also be a \par
        danger if you try to beat people over the head with your opinions and ideas. \par
        The problem is to avoid identifying your ego with what you believe. When you \par
        identify your ego with your ideas, you really believe you are those ideas, and \par
        you will defend them as if they were literally your own body. What you can do \par
        now is put all of your energy into expanding your mind. Look for experiences \par
        that will open up new dimensions of reality.\par
Terry_VB: lemme know when you're ready for more\par
pghoracle: im ready\par
Terry_VB: Venus is Conjunt Saturn starting today until the end of July....\par
Terry_VB: During this time, love and affection are strongly tempered by practical \par
        considerations. Sometimes under this influence you will ask an older person's\par
        advice about relationships, for you are reflecting about the state of your life and \par
        what your relationships mean to it. There is little tendency toward self- \par
        indulgence today. Your actions are characterized by restraint, which is usually \par
        good if you have to economize or recognize the limitations of your pocketbook. \par
        Under some conditions, this influence can indicate difficulties with your love \par
        relationships. You may not feel warm or affectionate, and you may alienate \par
        loved ones by seeming to be indifferent. A relationship that comes about \par
        during this time may be a long- lived but not flamboyant one, characterized by \par
        loyalty and soberness. \par
pghoracle: nice\par
pghoracle: stability in relationships\par
Terry_VB: do you know that venus is about to retrograde?\par
pghoracle: nah, but I do know\par
Terry_VB: from May 17 until June ?\par
Terry_VB: so everyone will be taking a close-look at our relationships\par
Terry_VB: but back to you   ;-)\par
Terry_VB: Your Moon is Trine Chiron today\par
Terry_VB: Almost everyone feels in one way or another unsure of themselves, \par
        vulnerable or inferior with regard to their bodies. Today's influence disturbs just\par
        this feeling of yours, but not painfully \- rather this is noticeable as a yearning to \par
        be accepted with all your hurts, to find understanding and love \- and thus also \par
        healing and relief. You are now far more aware of your own sensitivities, so \par
        that you are also in a position to be more considerate to yourself. If you do \par
        something good for your body today \- for example, have a massage or visit a \par
        sauna \- it will also strengthen your soul. Poetic and romantic music have a \par
        pronounced effect on you at this time.\par
pghoracle: dont know much about chiron\par
Terry_VB: Chiron was discovered in 1977.  Most Astrologers don't mention it, \par
        because it's so new and only an asteroid... but it is the wounded healer.\par
pghoracle: hmmm\par
pghoracle: cool\par
Terry_VB: It reflects our wounds as children\par
pghoracle: shall we talk about you?\par
Terry_VB: nah, I know about me.  I wanna know about you\par
pghoracle: well what would u like to know?\par
Terry_VB: hrmm..  how many times have you been in love?\par
pghoracle: well I have dated seriously a couple of times\par
pghoracle: but once in love\par
pghoracle: it was wonderful till we grew apart\par
Terry_VB: *nods*  How long have you been single?\par
pghoracle: 3 years\par
Terry_VB: May makes 4 for me\par
pghoracle: been quazi dating someone, but he is the sag\par
pghoracle: he cannot nor will not commit to one person\par
Terry_VB: nope\par
Terry_VB: but you know what you need\par
pghoracle: yeah, I am open to time, but I deserve someone that will love me and \par
        not the entire gay community\par
pghoracle: :-)\par
pghoracle: thus this has not happened so we both have started drifting away from \par
        each other on good tersm\par
pghoracle: terms\par
Terry_VB: I can't believe you haven't created that in your life.  Do you think that you've\par
        been waiting until you finished school so you could devote more of your time \par
        and energy into building a great relationship?\par
pghoracle: to be honest, yes\par
Terry_VB: I thought so\par
pghoracle: not certain of what I am going to do, nor where I am going to be\par
pghoracle: so i really kept myself somewhat detached\par
Terry_VB: *nods*  \par
Terry_VB: Do you feel as though you've outgrown Pittsburgh?\par
pghoracle: but I do miss having someone special that loves me\par
pghoracle: yeah somewhat, how did u know that?\par
Terry_VB: don't question it\par
Terry_VB: I don't know how\par
pghoracle: you are psychic too, like myself?\par
Terry_VB: yeah, pretty much\par
Terry_VB: ;-)\par
pghoracle: sweet, we have ALOT in common\par
Terry_VB: more than we realize just yet\par
pghoracle: hmmm\par
pghoracle: you are happy in virginia?\par
Terry_VB: I am, but I can be happy anywhere\par
pghoracle: what type of work at you into? Communication of somesort?\par
Terry_VB: well, for the past year and a half, I worked as a National Trainer for PF \par
        Chang's \par
pghoracle: PF changs, must travela bit\par
Terry_VB: I did, whenever we opened restaurants\par
pghoracle: did u come to Pittsburgh?\par
pghoracle: the waterfront?\par
pghoracle: :-)\par
Terry_VB: naw.  that store has been there awhile\par
pghoracle: yeah, bout 2 years\par
Terry_VB: yeah, before my time.  \par
pghoracle: u like it?\par
Terry_VB: I did.  I don't do it anymore\par
pghoracle: ahhh, so what are u into now?\par
Terry_VB: starting Monday, I'll be selling cars\par
pghoracle: what types?\par
Terry_VB: Dodges\par
pghoracle: sweet\par
pghoracle: ever done that?\par
Terry_VB: nope.\par
pghoracle: nervous?\par
Terry_VB: didn't ever think I was gonna be a car salesman\par
Terry_VB: not really.  I excel at anything I do\par
pghoracle: so what brought you to this point?\par
Terry_VB: it's a funny story, actually....\par
Terry_VB: the past few months I had been studying New Moon Astrology, so each \par
        New Moon I would make 10 wishes that i wanted to change in my life\par
pghoracle: and whalla\par
Terry_VB: basically, yeah\par
Terry_VB: I waited on a guy at PF Chang's and asked if he wanted to start with our \par
        Chicken Lettuce Wrap, and he asked me if I wanted a job\par
pghoracle: u serious?\par
Terry_VB: I was torn at first because I am so loyal to my employers\par
pghoracle: virgo\par
pghoracle: ugh\par
Terry_VB: but I accepted the job with him, even with my reservations\par
Terry_VB: and THEN, here's the kicker...\par
pghoracle: well hopefullu u will like it\par
Terry_VB: the next Wednesday, I waited on another sales manager\par
Terry_VB: this time from VB Dodge\par
Terry_VB: and HE offered me a job with him\par
Terry_VB: so I said, "Ok, I guess I'm supposed to go into car sales"\par
pghoracle: from the same company?\par
Terry_VB: no.  Another dealership\par
pghoracle: 2 differnt guys?\par
Terry_VB: yup, in 2 weeks\par
pghoracle: that is pretty weird\par
Terry_VB: totally by "chance"\par
pghoracle: opportunity was nockin\par
Terry_VB: AND during a freakin Mercury Retrograde when you're not supposed to \par
        accept new jobs\par
pghoracle: well hopefully it wont be short lived\par
Terry_VB: I don't plan on being there longer than a year or so\par
Terry_VB: it's a stepping stone\par
pghoracle: well thats cool\par
pghoracle: all paths lead to the destination\par
Terry_VB: we can't mess up\par
pghoracle: nope, its all experiences\par
Terry_VB: I'm so glad I met you today.  You've put the pep back in my step\par
Terry_VB: I've had bronchitis the past 5 days and have felt like shit\par
pghoracle: ugh, that sucks\par
Terry_VB: yeah, I know.  It's all good, though.  The antibiotics will kick it\par
pghoracle: sooner or later\par
Terry_VB: how long have you been HIV+?\par
pghoracle: well since I was 19\par
Terry_VB: wow, you got it young.  I just got it last year\par
pghoracle: well u were young too\par
pghoracle: :-)\par
Terry_VB: found out on Friday the 13th, in June\par
Terry_VB: 2 days after Saturn moved into my 8th house\par
pghoracle: hiv is not a biggie\par
Terry_VB: naw, it's made me a much better person\par
Terry_VB: despite the challenges\par
pghoracle: it makes u understand that life can be limited no matter what, so do \par
        what u need\par
Terry_VB: It just totally changes your perspective of life.  From the HIV room it's \par
        obvious it means different things to different people\par
pghoracle: yeah, I really dont regret having it\par
Terry_VB: every day since I found out last year, I consciously make a point (when I \par
        feel down) to find things that I'm grateful for and wouldn't have happened if I \par
        wasn't HIV+\par
pghoracle: you will never regret it\par
pghoracle: other than dating aspects\par
Terry_VB: well, knowing there are guys like you out there is what keeps my faith\par
pghoracle: its all part of the process\par
Terry_VB: I agree\par
pghoracle: well I should ask\par
pghoracle: do u find urself more comfortable being a top or bottom in sexual \par
        relationships?\par
pghoracle: or a versatile fella?\par
Terry_VB: I do whatever it takes to please the person I'm with\par
Terry_VB: so I guess that makes me versatile\par
pghoracle: me too\par
Terry_VB: I don't know how anyone can be 100% of one or the other\par
pghoracle: I know, some guys are\par
Terry_VB: not in a relationship anyway\par
Terry_VB: oh, I know some too\par
Terry_VB: you like your ears nibbled, don't you?\par
pghoracle: of course\par
pghoracle: love being petted too!!!!!!!!!!!!!\par
Terry_VB: is kissing as important to you as it is me?\par
pghoracle: I love kissing if it clicks\par
pghoracle: u know what i mean\par
Terry_VB: oh yeah\par
Terry_VB: there's gotta be chemistry\par
pghoracle: yepers, some I love kissing, others i wont\par
Terry_VB: I know what you mean\par
pghoracle: are you more of a giving or needing person?\par
Terry_VB: I am almost always the giver in my friendships/relationships\par
pghoracle: I tend to be too, but I guess I do LOVE attention\par
Terry_VB: with your Moon in Leo, I'll bet you do  ;-)\par
pghoracle: but then I give it equally when I given to\par
Terry_VB: well, once we're aware of who we are, we realize there's no difference \par
        between giving and receiving\par
pghoracle: very true, nice thought\par
Terry_VB: I have nice thoughts every now and again\par
Terry_VB: I have dirty thoughts every now and again, too\par
pghoracle: dirty thoughts are only natural for animals\par
pghoracle: which we are\par
Terry_VB: right\par
Terry_VB: only they're not dirty\par
Terry_VB: it's all relative\par
pghoracle: yep\par
pghoracle: purrrrrrrrrrr\par
Terry_VB: what is your greatest weakness?\par
pghoracle: wow\par
pghoracle: attention to detail in everything and everyone\par
Terry_VB: no, that is one of your greatest strengths\par
Terry_VB: God is in the details\par
Terry_VB: are you meaning how you have to anaylze everything in everything and \par
        everyone?\par
Terry_VB: oops.   analyze\par
pghoracle: yep\par
Terry_VB: my greatest weakness is always believing in the good in people and not \par
        necessarily seeing "what is"\par
pghoracle: the forest for the trees\par
