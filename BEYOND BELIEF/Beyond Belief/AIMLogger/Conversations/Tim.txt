last summer
noetall@cox.net says:
no wonder Rock was after you
Tim says:
well he still is
noetall@cox.net says:
true
noetall@cox.net says:
you are very handsome
Tim says:
thanks 
noetall@cox.net says:
you're so welcome
noetall@cox.net says:
just being honest
Tim says:
he seems really interested in me,\
noetall@cox.net says:
and you in him
Tim says:
huh?
noetall@cox.net says:
and you seem interested in him
Tim says:
yes, well im open
Tim says:
im not tied to anybody you know
Tim says:
after all i am just talking to him online
noetall@cox.net says:
I know   
Tim says:
i did tell him that since i wasnt rushing into anything
Tim says:
i would be patient with him
Tim says:
so..........
Tim says:
i am going to drag this out
noetall@cox.net says:
:-\  well, you can wait forever if you want
noetall@cox.net says:
:-/
Tim says:
no
Tim says:
im not waiting on anything real
Tim says:
i didnt think i would anyway
Tim says:
but now i know a little bit behind it
Tim says:
so i will just talk to him online
noetall@cox.net says:
 
Tim says:
is that bad??
noetall@cox.net says:
naw, I don't think so... as long as you don't lead HIM on
Tim says:
why
noetall@cox.net says:
that would be wrong
Tim says:
he knows that i dont fuck around
Tim says:
i mean he would definatly know by now
noetall@cox.net says:
I mean lead him on to believe he's going to meet you in person
noetall@cox.net says:
if you have no intention to
Tim says:
well the only way i would meet him in person is he really showed me that i was different you know
Tim says:
but since that probably isnt going to happen
noetall@cox.net says:
If you wanna know what I believe, I believe you're going to keep talking to him, and he's going to sweet talk you like he has and you're going to meet him
Tim says:
no....
Tim says:
i have been innocent this long
Tim says:
and i dont just settle
noetall@cox.net says:
You are telling me you dont' want to meet him
Tim says:
i dont do hookups and never will
noetall@cox.net says:
I'm not talking about a hookup
noetall@cox.net says:
just meeting him
Tim says:
he told me that if he ever does meet me that he wont jump into bed right away
Tim says:
b/c i dont do that
noetall@cox.net says:
but I thought you didn't like married or bisexual guys anyway?
Tim says:
i dont
noetall@cox.net says:
you're confusing me  
Tim says:
sorry
noetall@cox.net says:
you're saying one thing, then totally contradicting it
noetall@cox.net says:
which is OK
Tim says:
if he shows me realistically (i mean in real life) that he is totally different than what we know to be 
Tim says:
im speaking hypothetically too
noetall@cox.net says:
but even if he does prove not to be what everyone says, the fact remains he's either married or has a girlfriend
noetall@cox.net says:
how can he have an open relationship with a guy if he has a girlfriend
noetall@cox.net says:
bisexual guys don't do that
Tim says:
that is the thing
noetall@cox.net says:
they have their girlfriend for public
noetall@cox.net says:
then they have the gay guy
Tim says:
he WILL NOT get me period...
Tim says:
with the bitch
Tim says:
and he knows this
Tim says:
afterall i am worth it arent i
noetall@cox.net says:
And you think he would dump the girl for you?
Tim says:
no i dont
Tim says:
im just saying if that were to happen
noetall@cox.net says:
so you would hope that he would
Tim says:
i said IF that would be the case
noetall@cox.net says:
A closeted guy like Ian is not going to drop his girlfriend for a gay guy
Tim says:
that is the only way somebody will have me.......
noetall@cox.net says:
or his wife
Tim says:
exactly
Tim says:
im speaking in general him or anybody
noetall@cox.net says:
*nods*
Tim says:
friends first and then whatever
noetall@cox.net says:
well, you are too good of a guy for someone not to give you 100%
Tim says:
exactly
noetall@cox.net says:
so how long do you wait before you have sex?
Tim says:
i have too much respect for other people and myself
Tim says:
i dont know but its killing me.....i need it bad
noetall@cox.net says:
lol
Tim says:
but i have  to do it right
noetall@cox.net says:
I understand
Tim says:
so i am going to pull my guard back up
noetall@cox.net says:
My ex was only supposed to be a trick.  I fell in love with him the first night we met
Tim says:
really
noetall@cox.net says:
nah, leave your guard down
noetall@cox.net says:
you never know when the right person may want in
Tim says:
if that happens i will know it and let them in
Tim says:
now just so you dont think i am a dumbass
Tim says:
the situation with Ian is..........
Tim says:
i do only talk to him online......and he tells me what he wants to tell me whether it is a lie or truth at the heart of it......who knows 
Tim says:
so that it will remain....only online......but no more sex talk
Tim says:
and not to worry about meeting him.......
Tim says:
b/c i dont do hookups
noetall@cox.net says:
It's just hard for me to see someone like you interested in him
noetall@cox.net says:
I mean I know I just met you
noetall@cox.net says:
but I am a good judge of character 
Tim says:
ahhhhhhhhh
Tim says:
love your heart
noetall@cox.net says:
and have been around the Internet for a long time
noetall@cox.net says:
and you are unique
Tim says:
 
Tim says:
yes i am
Tim says:
you know that
noetall@cox.net says:
I am learning
Tim says:
i know that
Tim says:
and even if he is a player.......he knows that
noetall@cox.net says:
he has to
noetall@cox.net says:
I just can't understand why you're single
Tim says:
i dont rush him into anything
noetall@cox.net says:
you seem perfect
Tim says:
i guess i am ugly or something
noetall@cox.net says:
you are a 10 in my book
Tim says:
you sound like Ian....hehehe
noetall@cox.net says:
and I have very picky tastes
Tim says:
sorry
noetall@cox.net says:
 
noetall@cox.net says:
it's ok
noetall@cox.net says:
but your look is my "type"  that's all
noetall@cox.net says:
dark hair / eyes
Tim says:
so may the best man when
Tim says:
we should meet sometime for drinks or something
noetall@cox.net says:
who's competing?
Tim says:
you dont think i am stupid do you
Tim says:
for this
Tim says:
ill just take it day by day
noetall@cox.net says:
That's all any of us can do
Tim says:
i mean with Ian
noetall@cox.net says:
*nods*
Tim says:

noetall@cox.net says:

Tim says:

noetall@cox.net says:
I understand completely
Tim says:

Tim says:
