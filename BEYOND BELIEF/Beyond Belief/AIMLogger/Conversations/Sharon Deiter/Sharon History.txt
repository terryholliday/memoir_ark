Terry_VB_m 8/5/00   10:27 PM Hey Sharon, 
                                  I hope my favorite lesbian in the whole wide
                                  world is doing just great.  I had one question
                                  for you.  I was going to come visit you girls
                                  in the Help room, but I couldn't find the
                                  password.  Where do I look?  Or is there a
                                  reason I couldn't find it?

Terry_VB_m 8/12/00  1:48 AM  Oh, wow!  It's my favorite lesbian in the
                                  whole wide world.

Sharon K   8/12/00  1:51 AM  hey there sweetie *S*

Terry_VB_m 8/12/00  1:51 AM  I was hoping you'd be at the meeting tonight. 
                                  It was kind of boring.  But you'd have put a
                                  smile on my face.

Sharon K   8/12/00  1:53 AM  was it.. I was working.. *sigh*
                                  I am trying to figure when they are tomorrow
                                  LOLOLL shame on me

Terry_VB_m 8/12/00  1:54 AM  12 noon EST.

Sharon K   8/12/00  1:55 AM  thanks *S* so sweet.. was anything dealt with?

Terry_VB_m 8/12/00  1:56 AM  Not really.  Bunch of bull.  I asked some
                                  pretty interesting questions....  

Sharon K   8/12/00  1:57 AM  well I thought I would have the transcript and
                                  I dont.. 

Terry_VB_m 8/12/00  2:00 AM  You guys get it pretty fast?

Terry_VB_m 8/16/00  1:14 AM  Hey gorgeous... How's life treating you?

Sharon K   8/16/00  1:15 AM  aw wonderful handsome. *S* 
                                  how are you??

Terry_VB_m 8/16/00  1:16 AM  Ugh, tired!  I crashed around 8:30 and just
                                  woke up.  Now THAT'S a nap.

Sharon K   8/16/00  1:17 AM  uh huh.. I should be asleep lolol

Terry_VB_m 8/16/00  1:20 AM  Hey, when does the "new class" start?

Sharon K   8/16/00  1:21 AM  we will find out for sure thursday.. I think
                                  the end of the month if pup can get all the
                                  password stuff ready

Terry_VB_m 8/16/00  1:21 AM  She is a good woman.  I don't know how she
                                  does it all.  Is this her FT job or does she
                                  just do it in her "spare" time?

Sharon K   8/16/00  1:23 AM  this is her full time job.. she has a lot to
                                  do for gay.com.. the chathouse is just a part
                                  of it.. she does work hard though

Terry_VB_m 8/16/00  1:24 AM  I figured it had to be.  I couldn't imagine
                                  how she could just do it as a part-time job.
                                  
                                  You know I tried to find a way to come visit
                                  you guys on the Women's floor one night about
                                  a week or so ago (shortly after your visit to
                                  the Southeastern floor), but couldn't find a
                                  password.   :(

Sharon K   8/16/00  1:25 AM  only the MRT has the passwords to both sides..
                                  when anyone else goes to visit each side..
                                  they just do not have powers.. just make sure
                                  male monitor is is your profile *S*

Terry_VB_m 8/16/00  1:26 AM  It's not a big deal as long as I have you on
                                  ICQ. *wink*
                                  
                                  I just love me some lesbian!  *S*

Sharon K   8/16/00  1:27 AM  LOLOLOL hahaha

Terry_VB_m 8/16/00  1:27 AM  Well, it was good seeing you.

                                  weekend, but I'm sure gonna try.

Terry_VB_m 8/23/00  12:16 AM Hey gorgeous.

                                  schedule to start at the end of the month?

                                  sent.  Everyone was whining.... "There's a
                                  para-site here...There's a basher there."

Sharon K   8/23/00  12:38 AM oh my.. did you offer them cheese with their

                                  to recoup.

Terry_VB_m 8/23/00  11:24 PM Can I be a butch lesbian?

Sharon K   8/23/00  11:27 PM oh please do *S*S*S

Terry_VB_m 8/23/00  11:30 PM LOL!  There was this employee today at work
                                  that I was doing fingerprints on.  Her name
                                  was Dorothy.  We started talking about how she
                                  was from Kansas and goes by her middle name
                                  Kim because she doesn't look like a Dorothy. 
                                  I said, "I'd be a Dorothy before you would." 
                                  Then she said we could both sing "somwhere
                                  over the rainbow."  I think she knew I was
                                  gay.  We both cackled and gave each other a
                                  high five.  I forgot to mention she was 6'1",
                                  190# and butch.

Sharon K   8/23/00  11:30 PM LOLOLOLOL too funny LOL

Terry_VB_m 8/23/00  11:31 PM I just busted out laughing tonight thinking
                                  about it.  I mean I'm pretty masculine..but
                                  when she said that, I couldn't stop laughing. 
                                  

Sharon K   8/23/00  11:38 PM LOLOL 
                                  I am not masculine hehehehe 

Terry_VB_m 8/23/00  11:39 PM That's alright.  I'd be butch enough for both
                                  of us *S*

Sharon K   8/23/00  11:39 PM aw thats what they all say hehe

Terry_VB_m 8/23/00  11:40 PM Right!  I'm sure.  Well, my wrists don't toss
                                  in the air.  And I very RARELY have used the
                                  phrase, "you go girl!"

Sharon K   8/23/00  11:41 PM ROTFLMAO... good!!!

Terry_VB_m 8/26/00  12:49 AM I'm sure I'll catch hell for leaving without
                                  saying bye.  But they just left me there while
                                  they went dancing...then I don't have a clue
                                  where they went.  There was a fight...then I
                                  left.

Terry_VB_m 8/26/00  12:50 AM Yes, I think that would make it even.  Maybe I
                                  should tell them I'm gay so they won't ask me
                                  to go to the straight club anymore.

Sharon K   8/26/00  12:50 AM LOLOL naw.. wait and get even hehe

Terry_VB_m 8/26/00  12:51 AM Not tell them it's a gay bar?

Sharon K   8/26/00  12:52 AM uh huh *WEG*

Sharon K   8/26/00  12:52 AM Yell *SUPRISE* hahahah

Terry_VB_m 8/26/00  12:52 AM Well, I think that would be fair.

Sharon K   8/26/00  12:52 AM and go dancing and leave them there ROTFLMAO

Sharon K   8/26/00  12:53 AM I would never do that, but it sounds funny

Terry_VB_m 8/26/00  12:53 AM LOL!  Atta girl!  You are wicked tonight.  I
                                  love it!

Terry_VB_m 8/26/00  12:53 AM Yes, it definitely does.

Sharon K   8/26/00  12:53 AM *innocent smile* Muhahahahaha

Terry_VB_m 8/26/00  12:53 AM Unh huh!  

Sharon K   8/26/00  12:54 AM *grin*
                                  
                                  *batting my big blues*
                                  see??? I am innocent *S*

Terry_VB_m 8/26/00  12:54 AM Oh, I have NO doubt.

Sharon K   8/26/00  12:55 AM *S* uh huh.. that is me *S*  O ; }

Terry_VB_m 8/26/00  12:55 AM Right!  And I'm a republican.

Sharon K   8/26/00  12:56 AM LOLOL ewwwwwwww you are?

Terry_VB_m 8/26/00  12:56 AM NOT!

Sharon K   8/26/00  12:56 AM LOLOL Yuk..
                                  bad and a boy too LOL tsk tsk

Terry_VB_m 8/26/00  1:37 AM  Do you think this is appropriate?
                                  
                                   Please say hello to Heads Up (NO JOKE!!)
                                  [24.4.155.83]: someone in the room in infected
                                  with HIV 
                                  
   antibodies, and you should all BE SAFE..

Sharon K   8/26/00  1:38 AM  it is right on the edge.. if they say it is
                                  not directed at anyone, then it is just
                                  questionable.. 

Sharon K   8/26/00  1:38 AM  if they are in there damaging someone it is
                                  harrassment.

Terry_VB_m 8/26/00  1:39 AM  Right.  I didn't say anything to
                                  him...however, if he starts to name names,
                                  should I boot him?

Sharon K   8/26/00  1:39 AM  yes
                                  

Terry_VB_m 8/26/00  1:39 AM  Gotcha.  I just wanted to run it by you and
                                  see if you agreed.

Sharon K   8/26/00  1:40 AM  that is how I see it *S*

Sharon K   8/26/00  1:40 AM  we have enough troubles in this world without
                                  ppl doing things like that.. *S*

Terry_VB_m 8/26/00  1:40 AM  And you know I'd agree with anything you said.

Terry_VB_m 8/26/00  1:40 AM  Exactly.  

Sharon K   8/26/00  1:41 AM  *S* lol

Terry_VB_m 8/26/00  1:47 AM  Another question for you... Do you patrol the
                                  floor for parasites/escorts, etc. or do you
                                  wait for people to come to you?

Sharon K   8/26/00  1:47 AM  well if I am not busy I do it.. Like now.. we
                                  do not have escorts and such show up here like
                                  you all do though.. 

Sharon K   8/26/00  1:48 AM  I do look in the rooms and just go in and ban
                                  them .. and report it though.

Terry_VB_m 8/26/00  1:48 AM  I'm sure the women's floor is much easier to
                                  manage than the men's.

Terry_VB_m 8/26/00  1:49 AM  As soon as I get some more memory and my DSL,
                                  I'm sure I'll do that.  But right now my
                                  computer is too slow to be doing that.

Sharon K   8/26/00  1:49 AM  aw.. well over here it is pretty easy.. we are
                                  a small floor *S*
                                  

Terry_VB_m 8/26/00  1:50 AM  Plus, guys are normally more trouble.

Sharon K   8/26/00  1:51 AM  YES they are *S* 

Terry_VB_m 8/26/00  1:51 AM  *shrugs*  Oh, well.

Sharon K   8/26/00  1:52 AM  lol ya ya I know you cannot help it.. BUT if
                                  you were a lesbian.. this would not be an
                                  issue now would it Mister????? hm?

Terry_VB_m 8/26/00  1:52 AM  I know.  I say a prayer every night when I go
                                  to bed.
                                  
                                  *S*

Sharon K   8/26/00  1:53 AM  well that is a wise choice *S*

Terry_VB_m 8/26/00  1:53 AM  hehehehe

Sharon K   8/26/00  1:53 AM  *G*

Terry_VB_m 8/26/00  2:17 AM  Very slow night here on the gay.com prarie.

Sharon K   8/26/00  2:18 AM  ya here too.. we have some real bitches
                                  though.. they wanted to be monitors.. so they
                                  are being nasty.. 

Terry_VB_m 8/26/00  2:18 AM  I don't know why.  Did you tell them it's not
                                  some glamour job.

Sharon K   8/26/00  2:22 AM  no I did not lolol maybe they thought it was
                                  for the in crowd 

Terry_VB_m 8/26/00  2:23 AM  Well, of course they want to be like
                                  you...what lesbian in her right mind wouldn't?
                                  

Sharon K   8/26/00  2:24 AM  wel it is not really that kewl LOL they just
                                  think it is *G*

Terry_VB_m 8/26/00  2:25 AM  I know.  I had NO idea.  But I'm very grateful
                                  that I did become a monitor because I never
                                  would have met you had I not.  That makes all
                                  the shit I've had to and ever will worthwhile.

Sharon K   8/26/00  2:26 AM  *S* I have met in real over 100 ppl in the
                                  last 4 years... it has been wonderful

Terry_VB_m 8/26/00  2:26 AM  You've met over 100 people IRL from here?

Sharon K   8/26/00  2:27 AM  uh huh *S* all the way from the states to Hong
                                  Kong to OZ.. *S*

                                  boyfriend (BIG MISTAKE), I'd say I've met that
                                  many.

Terry_VB_m 8/29/00  11:31 PM It's ok.  I know it's not something you can do
                                  on demand.
                                  
                                  I'm going to bed.  You can make me laugh
                                  another day.  However, just seeing your name
                                  on my computer screen does bring a smile to my
                                  face. *S*  I needed that.

Sharon K   8/29/00  11:31 PM *S**S*S* good hon.. has been one of those days

Sharon K   9/5/00   10:45 PM oh soooooo busy *S* how about you??

Terry_VB_m 9/5/00   10:48 PM I had a very nice day today.  I worked from
                                  8:30 to 7:30, then went to the airport and
                                  picked up my best friend who flew in from LA. 
                                  Then I took him through the Taco Bell drive
                                  thru for his dinner, then took him home.

Sharon K   9/5/00   10:49 PM I love taco bell.. I am pleased you had a good
                                  day.. unless you were being sarcastic Mister

                                  have a good day.  My coworkers bought me
                                  Chinese for lunch and my friend Alison brought
                                  a cake in and bought me balloons.  So yeah, I
                                  had a good day.

                                  capacity did someone compromise them?

Sharon K   9/5/00   11:11 PM you know.. I have not even been told at this
                                  point. I dont think it was on our floor.. but
                                  I am not sure..

Terry_VB_m 9/5/00   11:12 PM I don't know.  I'm just glad I got my
                                  passwords.  There are quite a few of the
                                  monitors who didn't and were left in the cold
                                  over the weekend.

Sharon K   9/5/00   11:13 PM yes I saw that *sigh*

Terry_VB_m 9/5/00   11:14 PM I know they said the southeastern floor was
                                  without a monitor over the weekend.  I was out
                                  of town visiting my new nephew so I wasn't
                                  home to monitor.

Sharon K   9/5/00   11:16 PM I wish someone would have let me know as I am
                                  able to go there.. 

Terry_VB_m 9/5/00   11:16 PM I dunno....

Sharon K   9/5/00   11:16 PM I have to go now.. you have a wonderful sleep

Sharon K   9/9/00   1:48 AM  that would be lovely *S*S*S 

Terry_VB_m 9/9/00   1:48 AM  Yes, it would be...and it will be.

Sharon K   9/9/00   2:06 AM  sorry was away in my mail LOL

Terry_VB_m 9/9/00   2:08 AM  That's alright.  I had gay.com drama to deal
                                  with.  I'm writing my "book" to Puppet now. 
                                  To give you a summarization, there was a guy
                                  in the Raleigh 1 room in NC whose username was
                                  another chatters, but this guy had that
                                  chatters home phone number in his username. 
                                  He also had detailed directions to the guy's
                                  house in his profile.

Terry_VB_m 9/9/00   2:14 AM  When I went in the room, that guy left.  For
                                  some reason I went down the list of chatters
                                  and found another chatter with the identical
                                  IP as the guy giving out the #.  I pvt'd him
                                  and informed him that I was banning him
                                  because of his other nick and that was not
                                  nice and NOT allowed.  Then the guy came back
                                  online with another IP (dynamic, ugh) and was
                                  whining that "it wasn't him."  

Sharon K   9/9/00   2:16 AM  oh lovely.. sheesh..

Terry_VB_m 9/9/00   2:17 AM  Then I had both of them in the help room.  One
                                  was whining because he's getting umpteen
                                  calls/messages and the other whining because
                                  "it wasn't him."
                                  
                                  The one whose number was being given out
                                  wanted names/phone numbers for people at the
                                  San Francisco office.  

Sharon K   9/9/00   2:18 AM  I bet.. well he would have had to have given
                                  out his number in the first place.. eveyone
                                  should be more careful

Terry_VB_m 9/9/00   2:19 AM  I told him there was nothing that could be
                                  done tonight and that he could call his local
                                  police dept.  The only bad thing was he said
                                  the guy left a msg that he was calling from a
                                  computer lab at UNC and that he wasn't going
                                  to stop.  If that was true, the provider
                                  wouldn't have been mindspring, would it?

Sharon K   9/9/00   2:20 AM  mindspring should not be at a university

Terry_VB_m 9/9/00   2:20 AM  I didn't think so.  I've got both IP's that he
                                  signed in under.

Sharon K   9/9/00   2:21 AM  the one guy should not give out his number and
                                  this would not happen.. there will be no way
                                  to keep the other one out.. 

Sharon K   9/9/00   2:22 AM  I just hate it when this kinda thing happens..

Terry_VB_m 9/9/00   2:22 AM  Can't Puppet contact the IP and let them in on
                                  it?
                                  
                                  Because when this guy sent me 3 threatening
                                  emails, she said she was going to contact his
                                  IP.

Sharon K   9/9/00   2:23 AM  oh good.. she is doing more of that lately..
                                  so that will be of great help

Terry_VB_m 9/9/00   2:23 AM  I know. 

Terry_VB_m 9/9/00   2:24 AM  I hope that will help him.  He just kept
                                  driving up the friggin wall.   "I'll fly out
                                  to San Francisco, if that's what it takes."

Sharon K   9/9/00   2:24 AM  *S* you go 

Terry_VB_m 9/9/00   2:26 AM  No, that's what he said.  I was like, well
                                  it's not going to do you any good.  I said,
                                  change your phone number: PROBLEM SOLVED.

Sharon K   9/9/00   2:29 AM  LOL yes

Terry_VB_m 9/9/00   2:30 AM  Whiney ass little bitches.
                                  
                                  And you wonder why I love me some lesbian.  
                                  
                                  I'm still writing this letter to Puppet.  I
                                  haven't even done my action report.  It may
                                  have to wait until tomorrow.  I have to work
                                  at 10.  Well, I dont' have to, but I am.

Terry_VB_m 9/9/00   2:39 AM  I bcc'd you the letter I wrote.  You'll have
                                  to let me know what you think.
                                  
                                  I think I'm going to pat myself on the back.  

Terry_VB_m 9/9/00   2:41 AM  I'm going to bed.  I can barely keep my eyes
                                  open.  I've been working too many hours of OT
                                  and then putting in time with gay.com.   What
                                  a work ethic I have?!

Sharon K   9/9/00   2:41 AM  ok sweetheart *S* I am off to bed as well..
                                  good job yough *S*

Terry_VB_m 9/9/00   2:41 AM  Thanks.  
                                  
                                  Sleep with angels.

                                  than any of the other monitors.

Terry_VB_m 9/19/00  1:03 AM  I know.  I should've let you.  I just figured
                                  you'd like it too much.  I don't want to be
                                  the one responsible for making you like guys.

                                  Hello. This is Mike. Kevin's BF. I am letting
                                  his friends know that he was taken to the
                                  hospital late this evening for coughing up
                                  blood due to his terminal health. As of 3am he
                                  is in the ICU under life support. The doctors
                                  says its because of him not taking his meds.
                                  But I KNOW it was because of how hurt we was
                                  about how he was treated on gay.com. The
                                  outcome is not good. Please pass along this to
                                  his friends. I hope Gay.com is happy!

                                  week in like 2 months that I hadn't worked any
                                  OT.  I'm making up for it this week, though.

                                  Thanksgiving went.

Sharon K   11/27/00 12:31 AM it was good..  *S**S
                                  
                                  how was yours?? good.. get lots of food?

Terry_VB_m 11/27/00 12:32 AM Too much food!
                                  
                                  I had so much fun spending time with my baby
                                  nephew.  He's 4 months old now and just a
                                  completely happy baby.  We took naps together
                                  and I just couldn't hold him enough.  I bought
                                  my mom, brother, and sister a computer for
                                  Christmas on Friday.  I got a camera to go
                                  with it so they could put him on the camera so
                                  I can see him in between visits.

Sharon K   11/27/00 12:33 AM WONDERFUL *S*S*S* that is so great..

Terry_VB_m 11/27/00 12:34 AM Yeah, I'm so excited about Christmas.  I
                                  cannot wait for them to open it up.

                                  growing up.

Sharon K   11/27/00 12:37 AM that is so way kewl.. *S* 

Terry_VB_m 11/27/00 12:37 AM Yeah, I'm especially excited b/c I didn't have
                                  the $$ to buy them anything nice for Christmas
                                  last year... so this year I wanted to get them

Terry_VB_m 12/3/00  3:00 PM  Blackbelt was looking for you.  He wanted me
                                  to tell you the next time I saw you.  I told
                                  him that Crystaline saw you more than I did. 
                                  Apparently she has him on her invisible list
                                  because she was online last night and he said
                                  he didn't see her on ICQ.  I was like
                                  *chuckling*  Oh, my.

                                  that you must have me on your visible list. 
                                  But yeah, I agree, he is pretty much DRAMA. 
                                  I'm like, "GET OVER IT"

Sharon K   12/3/00  3:04 PM  I have not been on ICQ since I saw you the
                                  other day... I dont turn it on too much.. you

Sharon K   12/3/00  3:04 PM  I put him on invisible though cuz I was going
                                  to have to tell him to kiss my royal ass *G*

Terry_VB_m 12/7/00  10:58 PM Hey gorgeous.... No, my modem died on Sunday
                                  and tonight is the first time I've been online
                                  since then.  I haven't really had time to miss
                                  it much.  I worked until 10 on Monday,
                                  midnight on Tuesday, and 1 a.m. last night.  I
                                  came home tonight b/c of my shows, but had I
                                  known Will & Grace was a rerun, I'd have
                                  worked late tonight.  I just have THAT much
                                  work to do.  Hope to talk to you soon.

Terry_VB_m 12/9/00  2:02 AM  I knew it had to be you when I got that
                                  message on ICQ from him.

Terry_VB_m 12/9/00  2:03 AM  So it wasn't you that "got him fired?"

Sharon K   12/9/00  2:03 AM  noway

Sharon K   12/9/00  2:03 AM  do you really want to know what happened??

Sharon K   12/9/00  2:03 AM  I can tell you briefly.. between us

Terry_VB_m 12/9/00  2:03 AM  You know I want the scoop.

Sharon K   12/9/00  2:03 AM  want a rum and coke with me??

                                  you and me.

Sharon K   12/9/00  2:04 AM  ok
                                  

Sharon K   12/9/00  2:04 AM  well he sent me an email

                                  I'd prefer a toasted almond, though.

Sharon K   12/9/00  2:04 AM  and it was about the other FM and TL..... 

Terry_VB_m 12/9/00  2:04 AM  What other FM?

Sharon K   12/9/00  2:04 AM  ok you can have a toasted almond.. whatever
                                  the hell it is *S*
                                  
                                  

Sharon K   12/9/00  2:05 AM  well he sent an email.. saying him and some
                                  other FM's agreed on such and such

Sharon K   12/9/00  2:05 AM  and that Jason and Mike such and such 
                                  

Sharon K   12/9/00  2:05 AM  LOL

Terry_VB_m 12/9/00  2:05 AM  and....

Sharon K   12/9/00  2:05 AM  so anyways.. at the end of this email.. he
                                  said this is between us..

Sharon K   12/9/00  2:05 AM  well it was slander on several others.. and it
                                  was also speaking for others..

Terry_VB_m 12/9/00  2:06 AM  uh oh!

Sharon K   12/9/00  2:06 AM  so in my official capacity.. I did need to
                                  share it, as it was detrimental to the team

Sharon K   12/9/00  2:06 AM  there is a line.. and not so fine of line..
                                  and he crossed it.. insulting my other TL's

Terry_VB_m 12/9/00  2:07 AM  He was insulting the Men's or the Women's
                                  TL's?

Sharon K   12/9/00  2:07 AM  it was not out of anger I shared it.. it was
                                  outta concern for the impact on the team, and
                                  the floors

Sharon K   12/9/00  2:07 AM  the mens.. 

Terry_VB_m 12/9/00  2:07 AM  ah...

Sharon K   12/9/00  2:07 AM  I have nothing against him at all.. honest

Sharon K   12/9/00  2:07 AM  we all talked about it in the TL meeting that
                                  day

Sharon K   12/9/00  2:08 AM  and we were all fine with it.. we thanked him
                                  for bringing the issues to us

Sharon K   12/9/00  2:08 AM  and we meant it..

Sharon K   12/9/00  2:08 AM  but he went on and on..

Terry_VB_m 12/9/00  2:08 AM  Were they even valid concerns?

Sharon K   12/9/00  2:08 AM  some of them yes.. and we were willing to get
                                  with them.. 

Terry_VB_m 12/9/00  2:08 AM  Too much politics

Sharon K   12/9/00  2:08 AM  it was not like that though

Sharon K   12/9/00  2:09 AM  I felt and do feel really bad about it..
                                  

Sharon K   12/9/00  2:09 AM  it is the first time I have had someone tell
                                  me I betrayed them

Terry_VB_m 12/9/00  2:09 AM  Yikes.  I dont' think you betrayed him.  You
                                  were just doing your job.

Sharon K   12/9/00  2:09 AM  it was like a threat of the FM striking and
                                  them breaking the rules..

Terry_VB_m 12/9/00  2:10 AM  Geesh!

Sharon K   12/9/00  2:10 AM  and he gave me the info.. and as a TL I had to
                                  respond

Sharon K   12/9/00  2:10 AM  I do honestly feel bad though.

Sharon K   12/9/00  2:10 AM  really bad to tell the truth..

Sharon K   12/9/00  2:10 AM  *hanging head*

Terry_VB_m 12/9/00  2:10 AM  Don't feel bad about it, Sharon.  You did what
                                  you had to do.  He'll get over it.  You're
                                  still on the pedestal I put you on.

Sharon K   12/9/00  2:11 AM  I know I did not betray him.. as after the
                                  meeting we sent him a letter.. thanking him
                                  for sharing thoughts he thought were valid

Sharon K   12/9/00  2:11 AM  thanks.. *sigh*

Sharon K   12/9/00  2:11 AM  sorry.. I am having a rough time here.. 

Terry_VB_m 12/9/00  2:11 AM  Well, I had a rough week myself.

Sharon K   12/9/00  2:12 AM  ya

Terry_VB_m 12/9/00  2:12 AM  Yup.  I got written up at work.

Sharon K   12/9/00  2:12 AM  tis one of those weeks I guess

Sharon K   12/9/00  2:12 AM  oh my.. what happened?

Sharon K   12/9/00  2:12 AM  LOL you may end up knowing more about me than
                                  most.. LOL I dont drink and I am having
                                  several right now

Terry_VB_m 12/9/00  2:13 AM  LONG STORY... the girl they hired last month
                                  filed a "workplace violence" complaint against
                                  me.  They investigated and found it wasn't
                                  workplace violence (Thank goodness, otherwise
                                  I'd be out of a job), but they still wrote me
                                  up for reading her email and also for being
                                  rude to an employee.

Terry_VB_m 12/9/00  2:13 AM  I wish I could have a drink.  I don't have any
                                  liquor.

Sharon K   12/9/00  2:14 AM  sorry.. here you go.. 

Terry_VB_m 12/9/00  2:14 AM  Thanks!

Sharon K   12/9/00  2:14 AM  one kid is sleeping.. the g/f is sleeping and
                                  the other is overnighting at a friends.

                                  I worked 65 hours this week.

Sharon K   12/9/00  2:15 AM  it is one of those things in life.. just
                                  another example of diff ppl's persceptions
                                  

Sharon K   12/9/00  2:16 AM  oh my.. I only worked 55

Terry_VB_m 12/9/00  2:16 AM  That's what they said.  Perception is
                                  realitiy.

                                  thoughts.  It's a good thing, though.

Sharon K   12/9/00  2:59 AM  feels like today though

Terry_VB_m 12/9/00  2:59 AM  I'm sure it's still pretty hard, though.

Sharon K   12/9/00  2:59 AM  oh ya.. rougher than most things in my life..

                                  I can't think of anything I'd rather have than
                                  your trust.

Terry_VB_m 12/9/00  3:01 AM  What did your son do that you had to go to
                                  court over?

Terry_VB_m 12/9/00  3:03 AM  Even having a happy mama?

Sharon K   12/9/00  3:03 AM  I let them live with their father for a year

Terry_VB_m 12/9/00  3:03 AM  They wanted to?

Sharon K   12/9/00  3:03 AM  they begged to

Sharon K   12/9/00  3:03 AM  but

Sharon K   12/9/00  3:03 AM  their father had been charged with child abuse
                                  and neglect before

Terry_VB_m 12/9/00  3:04 AM  Yikes!  

Sharon K   12/9/00  3:04 AM  and their father went to classes

Terry_VB_m 12/9/00  3:04 AM  Is he any better now?

Sharon K   12/9/00  3:04 AM  so they asked to please let them stay

Terry_VB_m 12/9/00  3:04 AM  You were a good woman to do that, Sharon.

Sharon K   12/9/00  3:04 AM  ya, well their father did about the same to
                                  them

Sharon K   12/9/00  3:05 AM  to him should I say

Terry_VB_m 12/9/00  3:05 AM  Sexually abused him or physically?

Sharon K   12/9/00  3:05 AM  the kids never told me

Sharon K   12/9/00  3:05 AM  physically

Sharon K   12/9/00  3:05 AM  he did not bother my daugheter

Sharon K   12/9/00  3:05 AM  daughter

Terry_VB_m 12/9/00  3:05 AM  That really sucks.  I'm so sorry.

Sharon K   12/9/00  3:05 AM  only my don

Sharon K   12/9/00  3:05 AM  yes he was

Terry_VB_m 12/9/00  3:06 AM  Isn't that strange how they just pick a child
                                  to be abusive to?

Sharon K   12/9/00  3:06 AM  that was years ago.

Terry_VB_m 12/9/00  3:06 AM  The BASTARD!  Let me at em

Sharon K   12/9/00  3:06 AM  yes.. now my son is so screwed up

Sharon K   12/9/00  3:06 AM  it wont help

Terry_VB_m 12/9/00  3:06 AM  Still!  No one messes with my Sharon.  Either
                                  now or in the past.

Sharon K   12/9/00  3:06 AM  my son is so angry

Sharon K   12/9/00  3:06 AM  it doesnt help

Terry_VB_m 12/9/00  3:06 AM  Has he tried counseling?

Sharon K   12/9/00  3:06 AM  my son??

Terry_VB_m 12/9/00  3:06 AM  yes.

Sharon K   12/9/00  3:07 AM  yes, on my son. until he wanted to hang
                                  himself

Terry_VB_m 12/9/00  3:07 AM  Oi vey

Sharon K   12/9/00  3:07 AM  it is so much for his itty bitty mind

Terry_VB_m 12/9/00  3:07 AM  especially at 16

Sharon K   12/9/00  3:07 AM  he is doing ok, except he is self medicating
                                  his life

Terry_VB_m 12/9/00  3:07 AM  What meds?

Sharon K   12/9/00  3:07 AM  he is a wonderful being thoug 

Terry_VB_m 12/9/00  3:08 AM  He has to be...to be your son.

Sharon K   12/9/00  3:08 AM  he refuses meds now.. he is medicating with
                                  drugs. ... off the streets

Sharon K   12/9/00  3:08 AM  it is sad..

Sharon K   12/9/00  3:08 AM  too sad for words

Sharon K   12/9/00  3:09 AM  but in the process my daily life right now is
                                  messed up

Terry_VB_m 12/9/00  3:09 AM  Lord!  That's not the way...  I'll definitely
                                  keep him in my prayers....and you, too.  God
                                  knows you need the strength to get through
                                  this.

Sharon K   12/9/00  3:09 AM  yes

Sharon K   12/9/00  3:09 AM  so true

Sharon K   12/9/00  3:09 AM  *crying*

Sharon K   12/9/00  3:09 AM  life is so tough at times

Sharon K   12/9/00  3:09 AM  but all in the progress of the future, I do
                                  believe

Terry_VB_m 12/9/00  3:10 AM  Everything happens for a reason.  Like I told
                                  myself yesterday when I got written up.  God
                                  doesn't close a door without opening a window.

Sharon K   12/9/00  3:10 AM  he is into alot of drugs.. atleast he tells me
                                  about it all.

Terry_VB_m 12/9/00  3:10 AM  That's good that you have that kind of
                                  relationship with him.

Sharon K   12/9/00  3:10 AM  that is so true. there is always a reason for
                                  everything

Sharon K   12/9/00  3:11 AM  yes, I have an open realationshitp with them

Terry_VB_m 12/9/00  3:11 AM  You're a good mom, Sharon.  

Sharon K   12/9/00  3:11 AM  makes me crazy LOL but I live

Sharon K   12/9/00  3:11 AM  ya, I know

Sharon K   12/9/00  3:11 AM  but damn

Terry_VB_m 12/9/00  3:11 AM  You're a truly incredible person.  I wish I
                                  could have a relationship with my mom like you
                                  seem to have with your son.

Terry_VB_m 12/9/00  3:11 AM  I can't talk to my mom about my being gay. 
                                  She just refuses to believe it or even listen.

Sharon K   12/9/00  3:12 AM  I have a great open relationship with my
                                  children

Sharon K   12/9/00  3:12 AM  ya, well that is your mothers loss

Sharon K   12/9/00  3:12 AM  it is always best to know who you are dealing
                                  with in life

Terry_VB_m 12/9/00  3:12 AM  Well, we've never really communicated about
                                  personal things, even before I came out to
                                  her.  I guess it's not really any different.

Sharon K   12/9/00  3:13 AM  ya, well she is doing the best she can
                                  

Sharon K   12/9/00  3:13 AM  that is all we, as parents can do

Terry_VB_m 12/9/00  3:13 AM  I know.  I know she prays a lot about it.

Sharon K   12/9/00  3:13 AM  I just chose the route of knowing

Sharon K   12/9/00  3:13 AM  yes..

Sharon K   12/9/00  3:13 AM  prayer is good.. it does not change fact
                                  though

Terry_VB_m 12/9/00  3:14 AM  That's the biggest issue with her is the
                                  religious conflict.  I can't blame her, I had
                                  the same conflicts when I first realized the
                                  feelings.

Sharon K   12/9/00  3:14 AM  a fact is that you are the wonderful being you
                                  are meant to be

Sharon K   12/9/00  3:14 AM  I am not real religous

Terry_VB_m 12/9/00  3:14 AM  Thanks!  That's the way I try to look at it.

Sharon K   12/9/00  3:14 AM  but I do believe in my god

Sharon K   12/9/00  3:14 AM  it is true..

Terry_VB_m 12/9/00  3:15 AM  I haven't been since I realized I was gay.  It
                                  was just too hard to go to church and listen
                                  to the preacher talk about how he believed
                                  everything I was was wrong.

Sharon K   12/9/00  3:15 AM  we were all put here for whatever

Terry_VB_m 12/9/00  3:15 AM  I agree.  I don't believe I'm a biological
                                  error.

Sharon K   12/9/00  3:15 AM  well then darling.. you best go to a diff
                                  church *S*

Sharon K   12/9/00  3:15 AM  no, noone is..

Terry_VB_m 12/9/00  3:15 AM  I just quit going altogether.  I've kind of
                                  come to a pretty happy medium

Sharon K   12/9/00  3:16 AM  tis a difference of the different directions
                                  of the world

Terry_VB_m 12/9/00  3:16 AM  You're very wise, Sharon.

Sharon K   12/9/00  3:16 AM  we are the new world *S*

Sharon K   12/9/00  3:16 AM  ya

Terry_VB_m 12/9/00  3:16 AM  I agree.

Sharon K   12/9/00  3:17 AM  it is like we are not the old direction.. we
                                  are the one that is taking direction in the
                                  world in which we live

Terry_VB_m 12/9/00  3:17 AM  Yup.

                                  I got to see this side of you.  I'm very

Sharon K   12/15/00 12:55 AM I still dont have many words for anything.. 
                                  
                                  I know that makes little or no sence right now
                                  to you

Sharon K   12/15/00 12:55 AM damn it hard being blonde ontop of life
                                  sometimes *G*

Terry_VB_m 12/15/00 12:56 AM *S*  Even though you have so much on your
                                  plate right now, you can still bring a smile
                                  to my face.  Now THAT is talent.

Sharon K   12/15/00 12:57 AM well.. *smiling* lol
                                  
                                  I have been told that

Sharon K   12/15/00 12:57 AM hey check this out.. my partner took me to
                                  chinese dinner tonight.. and my fortune was

Sharon K   12/15/00 12:58 AM "you are the guiding light of his existence"

Terry_VB_m 12/15/00 12:58 AM You are!
                                  
                                  

Sharon K   12/15/00 12:59 AM it was so appropriate

Sharon K   12/15/00 12:59 AM *sigh*

Sharon K   12/15/00 12:59 AM this is making me crazy.. I usually handle
                                  heavy things so well

Sharon K   12/15/00 12:59 AM and I am just not doing as well as I always do

Terry_VB_m 12/15/00 12:59 AM I ate Chinese last Friday and my fortune
                                  cookie said, "It is easier to resist tempation
                                  at the beginning than at the end."  I was
                                  always told you are supposed to add "in bed"
                                  to the end of your fortune.  I was like,
                                  "that's SO true."

Sharon K   12/15/00 1:00 AM  must be a parental platue that I am not
                                  familiar with 

Sharon K   12/15/00 1:00 AM  LOLOL I was always told that when you read
                                  your fortune you were to just say.. In Bed
                                  

Terry_VB_m 12/15/00 1:00 AM  Well, sweetie...this isn't your everyday
                                  normal stress.  You handle different
                                  situations differently.  Whenever it involves
                                  your kids (who will always be part of you) you
                                  get more into it than other situations.

Sharon K   12/15/00 1:00 AM  LOL I heard the same thing.. LOLOL

Sharon K   12/15/00 1:01 AM  I want to be able to see it rationally..

Sharon K   12/15/00 1:01 AM  I just dont seem to be able to here

Terry_VB_m 12/15/00 1:01 AM  I understand...and I'm sure you will.  It just
                                  may take longer this time than all the others.

Sharon K   12/15/00 1:01 AM  I have NEVER been like this about anything..

Sharon K   12/15/00 1:01 AM  ya, I am having a few ok moments now

Terry_VB_m 12/15/00 1:01 AM  You are going to get through this, Sharon.  I
                                  have total faith in that.

Sharon K   12/15/00 1:02 AM  it is such a lost feeling

Terry_VB_m 12/15/00 1:02 AM  I can only imagine.

Sharon K   12/15/00 1:02 AM  I do know I will get through it..

Sharon K   12/15/00 1:02 AM  I look at it and think.. gawd, I am
                                  exagerating this

Sharon K   12/15/00 1:02 AM  and try to get a grip on it.. there just does
                                  not seem to be one..

Sharon K   12/15/00 1:02 AM  it is just plain sad..

Terry_VB_m 12/15/00 1:02 AM  I don't think you're exagerating it at all. 
                                  It only happened the other day, sweetie.

Sharon K   12/15/00 1:03 AM  it only happened 36 hours ago

Terry_VB_m 12/15/00 1:03 AM  Hey, Puppet fixed my account information, but
                                  I still can't update my profile with the new
                                  monitor uniform.

Sharon K   12/15/00 1:03 AM  I just wish I could will him the thoughts I am
                                  having..

Sharon K   12/15/00 1:03 AM  you cannot??

Sharon K   12/15/00 1:03 AM  I still cannot update mine either

Sharon K   12/15/00 1:04 AM  I forgot to ask until tonight though

Sharon K   12/15/00 1:04 AM  *sigh*

Terry_VB_m 12/15/00 1:04 AM  Yeah, I saw where you *raised your hand*

Sharon K   12/15/00 1:04 AM  LOLOL ya

Terry_VB_m 12/15/00 1:04 AM  It seems I was the first to report the
                                  problem.

Sharon K   12/15/00 1:04 AM  *sideways smile* 
                                  
                                  that would be me

Sharon K   12/15/00 1:04 AM  I only told someone.. I did not report it.. 

Sharon K   12/15/00 1:05 AM  so sorry.. was not my top issue hehehe

Sharon K   12/15/00 1:05 AM  I just thought.. oh another gay.com techie

Terry_VB_m 12/15/00 1:16 AM  Well, it's hard having to be nice to her
                                  considering 1) I don't get my raise b/c of
                                  her, 2) I can't post for the budgeting analyst
                                  position I really wanted, and 3) I'm on
                                  warning for I don't know how long.

Sharon K   12/15/00 1:16 AM  oh ya.. except you new wife to be

                                  such high scores...  I knocked their avg down
                                  a bit.

Terry_VB_m 12/15/00 1:32 AM  Some of these guys who post pictures deserve
                                  their scores.
                                  
                                  I don't know which one you're looking at.

                                  judgement.  I love being critical of others. 
                                  My favorite pass time is going to the mall,
                                  etc. and just sitting watching people and
                                  making fun of them with someone.

Terry_VB_m 12/15/00 1:36 AM  I just found it the other day.

Terry_VB_m 12/15/00 1:37 AM  For a girl, I'd rank that woman a "6"
                                  
                                  You should put your picture on that site so I
                                  can visit it like 100 times giving you a "10"

Sharon K   12/15/00 1:38 AM  LOLOL

                                  one of those.

                                  me know.  Even though I'm sure I'd be
                                  devastated by my overall score, I just want to
                                  get a feel for how good looking I am.

Terry_VB_m 12/15/00 1:45 AM  I hated to do it, but I just had to give this
                                  guy a "2"

Terry_VB_m 12/15/00 1:47 AM  *wonders how many of these guys are gay*

Sharon K   12/15/00 1:47 AM  what guy??

                                  Sux, you can't go back.  I guess I'll have to

Sharon K   12/15/00 1:50 AM  wow, I am enthralled with this site

Terry_VB_m 12/15/00 1:50 AM  I found the site while I was at work.  I was
                                  bookmarking that page right fast.  *thought to
                                  myself, now I know what I can do in my spare
                                  time*

                                  you.

Sharon K   12/15/00 1:52 AM  LOL

Terry_VB_m 12/15/00 1:53 AM  I just gave some kid a sympathy "7" 
                                  Apparently from his overall score, most people
                                  have done that.  I thought "you know, he's
                                  young, impressionable.  I don't want to crush
                                  him by giving him the 3 that he deserves."

Sharon K   12/15/00 1:53 AM  yes. I know what you are saying

Terry_VB_m 12/15/00 1:54 AM  but some of them I'm like, "ewww, you just
                                  plain ugly"

Sharon K   12/15/00 1:54 AM  uh huh. what a page. 

Terry_VB_m 12/15/00 1:55 AM  Aside from you, this is the best thing since
                                  sliced bread.

Terry_VB_m 12/15/00 1:55 AM  *bows* Thank you

Sharon K   12/15/00 1:56 AM  *smile*

Terry_VB_m 12/15/00 1:56 AM  You should hear some of the comments I'm
                                  making...
                                  
                                  This last guy I said, "his teeth are just too
                                  damn big."
                                  
                                  Then I stamped his forehead with a "5"

Sharon K   12/15/00 1:59 AM  LOL ok. .. how do you do that??

Sharon K   12/15/00 2:00 AM  I am still at the voting stage here

Terry_VB_m 12/15/00 2:00 AM  LOL!  That's what I meant by "stamping a '5'
                                  on his head"
                                  
                                  I wish I could do that.

Terry_VB_m 12/15/00 2:00 AM  That would be too mean... all these guys with
                                  4's and 5's on their foreheads.

Sharon K   12/15/00 2:01 AM  ROTFLMAO

Terry_VB_m 12/15/00 2:02 AM  Especially if I got to put my picture up
                                  there... but I'm sure I'd at least have a 6 on
                                  my forehead.  At least I hope I would.

                                  front of 30 queens...all of whom were talking.
                                   Thomas, my best friend, said I was groping
                                  her breats and grabbing her crotch.  I had
                                  flashbacks on Monday of her saying, "Ooo, you
                                  like that?  yeah?  yeah?"  See!  That's what I
                                  get for even thinking about marrying a woman.

Terry_VB_m 12/20/00 11:39 PM Oh, she's just told me that she'd move with me
                                  out to LA when I move next year...that she'd
                                  help me get established out there
                                  (financially)...that she cleans, cooks, ya
                                  know.  Not the typical domestic, but she said
                                  she works hard.

Sharon K   12/20/00 11:40 PM so you thinking about it??

Sharon K   12/20/00 11:41 PM I just asked her if you told her about last
                                  night.. she said um no.. and something.. then
                                  I said.. oh he baked cookies LOLOLOL

Terry_VB_m 12/20/00 11:42 PM No, not last night...  I did that with the
                                  girl on Saturday night.

Sharon K   12/20/00 11:43 PM ohhhh sorry.. was confused

Sharon K   12/20/00 11:43 PM *wondering about you*

Terry_VB_m 12/20/00 11:43 PM That's alright.  I forwarded the message that
                                  I sent you on Sunday when I was baking
                                  cookies.

Terry_VB_m 12/20/00 11:44 PM Who knew?  But just remember...after I made
                                  out with her for 30 minutes I rolled around in
                                  the floor with a guy for an hour (his legs in
                                  the air, both of our feet on the freshly
                                  painted walls)...then we both passed out on
                                  one another with people stepping over top of
                                  us to leave the party.

Sharon K   12/20/00 11:45 PM ROTFLMAO.. I think that makes you Bi darling
                                  hahahahhahaha

Terry_VB_m 12/20/00 11:47 PM No, it makes me DRUNK

Sharon K   12/20/00 11:47 PM ROTLMAO hahahahahah

Sharon K   12/20/00 11:47 PM *giggling*

Sharon K   12/20/00 11:47 PM you are adorable.. just adorable

Terry_VB_m 12/20/00 11:47 PM I was also a very mean drunk so I'm told.  I
                                  kinda remember this part.

Sharon K   12/20/00 11:48 PM oh, that is too bad.. 

Terry_VB_m 12/20/00 11:48 PM There's still a 4 hour window of time I don't
                                  recall at all.  This would be the time I made
                                  out with the guy.  I would remember making out
                                  with the girl.

Terry_VB_m 12/20/00 11:48 PM What's too bad?

Sharon K   12/20/00 11:49 PM that you were very mean hon

Sharon K   12/20/00 11:49 PM well was he cute??

Terry_VB_m 12/20/00 11:49 PM Oh...yeah.  I told my friend Scott when we got
                                  back to Thomas' (my best friend) that I was
                                  "OVER HIM"

Sharon K   12/20/00 11:50 PM heavens.. hehehe

Sharon K   12/20/00 11:50 PM I wish I was at that party

Terry_VB_m 12/20/00 11:50 PM The guy is incredibly cute...he ended up
                                  coming back to Thomas' with us...but slept in
                                  the bed with Scott.  He is a little too
                                  effeminate for me, anyway, but I'm not sure
                                  he's even interested now that he's sober.

Terry_VB_m 12/20/00 11:50 PM I'd have been all over YOU instead of the
                                  tramp on the couch.

Sharon K   12/20/00 11:51 PM LOL yes.. heheheheh Mwah

Sharon K   12/20/00 11:51 PM now you are thinking of gettin a wife.. a
                                  lesbian one at that LOL

Terry_VB_m 12/20/00 11:52 PM I told Spence that I was holding out to marry
                                  you but that since I didn't think that was
                                  going to happen I guess I could marry her.

Terry_VB_m 12/20/00 11:52 PM I know.. it's all very scary

Sharon K   12/20/00 11:53 PM ya, she is a sweetie.. she would be a great
                                  friend for life that is for sure

Terry_VB_m 12/20/00 11:54 PM Oh, I'm sure.  I think we've clicked.

Sharon K   12/20/00 11:55 PM she thinks you are wonderful.. 
                                  
                                  

Terry_VB_m 12/20/00 11:55 PM Awww...she's a darling, too.  I'd only
                                  consider marrying 1 other person, and I think
                                  you know who she is.

Sharon K   12/20/00 11:56 PM *puffing up* tis me..

Sharon K   12/20/00 11:56 PM I would marry you too *S*S*S*

Terry_VB_m 12/20/00 11:56 PM Yes, it is!

Terry_VB_m 12/20/00 11:57 PM If it wasn't for that daggone man/woman thing.

Sharon K   12/20/00 11:58 PM ya.. lol and I am really all gurlie heheh

Terry_VB_m 12/20/00 11:58 PM That's alright...apparently I'm becoming
                                  interested in the opposite sex. *shivers*

Sharon K   12/20/00 11:59 PM ROTFLMAO

Sharon K   12/20/00 11:59 PM *laughing*

Terry_VB_m 12/21/00 12:00 AM If my mom's prayers makes me straight I won't
                                  know what to do.  I'd be lost.  It'd be like
                                  learning to walk again.

                                  you, and one of the great things is that you

                                  just cuz I speak to them

Terry_VB_m 12/21/00 12:01 AM Just a tad.... *S*

                                  serious.

Sharon K   12/21/00 12:21 AM most definitely

Terry_VB_m 12/21/00 12:21 AM She may hook me up with a cheap processor and
                                  motherboard from Canada.  I get more bang for
                                  my buck up there.

Sharon K   12/21/00 12:22 AM ya... when I went and saw some friends a few
                                  years ago.. I bought a zip drive and scanner
                                  there.. was much cheaper

Terry_VB_m 12/21/00 12:23 AM Our dollar is worth $1.50 there.

Sharon K   12/21/00 12:24 AM that is good.. it was alot less over there at
                                  I think it was their Circut City that I found
                                  the best deals

Terry_VB_m 12/21/00 12:25 AM She may be able to get it b4 she comes down. 
                                  That'd be exciting.

Sharon K   12/21/00 12:26 AM ya.. that would be great *S*S**S*S

Terry_VB_m 12/21/00 12:26 AM yup yup

                                  something.. since i had not heard from you

Terry_VB_m 12/21/00 12:28 AM Not at all, sweetie.

Sharon K   1/1/01   10:52 PM you are??

Sharon K   1/1/01   10:53 PM Oh MY

Sharon K   1/1/01   10:53 PM I have not see anyone for awhile now.. so I
                                  was not sure what was going on there

Terry_VB_m 1/1/01   10:53 PM Yeah.  She came down to Richmond to visit her
                                  girl...and she is riding a bus down to VB
                                  tomorrow.  We were hoping that you'd be able
                                  to meet us.

Sharon K   1/1/01   10:53 PM It will be nice to get to meet someone from
                                  here anyways

Sharon K   1/1/01   10:54 PM I have to work all week, as I just had a 3 day
                                  w/e

Terry_VB_m 1/1/01   10:54 PM Right.  I wish it was you that I was
                                  meeting...not that I don't want to meet
                                  Spence..it's just ya know.  You're incredibly
                                  special.

Sharon K   1/1/01   10:55 PM *S* ya I know what you are saying.. *sigh*
                                  
                                  

Terry_VB_m 1/1/01   10:56 PM I figured you would. *S*

Sharon K   1/1/01   10:56 PM uh huh... *S**S

Terry_VB_m 1/1/01   10:56 PM What about next weekend?  She's here until the
                                  8th

Sharon K   1/1/01   10:56 PM so, what did you do last night?? run nikked in
                                  the streets??

Sharon K   1/1/01   10:56 PM I will look at my work schedule *S* that would
                                  be great

Terry_VB_m 1/1/01   10:57 PM No, I went to a party.

Terry_VB_m 1/1/01   10:57 PM My cousin's friend from work had a NYE party. 
                                  

Terry_VB_m 1/1/01   10:57 PM I took my new man.

Sharon K   1/1/01   10:57 PM you have a new man?? you did not tell me that
                                  mister..

Terry_VB_m 1/1/01   10:58 PM Well, I kinda just got him Friday.  Actually,
                                  I met him 3 months ago but he didn't want to
                                  date me b/c I'm moving to LA next year, but I
                                  asked him again on Friday after we went to a
                                  movie and he said he really wanted to date me.

Sharon K   1/1/01   10:59 PM well, maybe he will want to go with you to LA
                                  next year if it works out.. hm
                                  
                                  

Terry_VB_m 1/1/01   11:00 PM He doesn't really want to.  I guess I'll be
                                  taking Spence with me.

Sharon K   1/1/01   11:00 PM you and Spence have talked more about it??

Terry_VB_m 1/1/01   11:01 PM We talk about it as though it's going to
                                  happen.  Part of me is scared to death and
                                  another part of me says "go for it."

Sharon K   1/1/01   11:02 PM I imagine so, I did not think everyone was
                                  serious at first.. then when she said she
                                  really thought so, I guess I was a tad
                                  suprised..

Sharon K   1/1/01   11:02 PM but if you look at it for practical purposes..
                                  it really should not hurt anything.. I dunno
                                  what I really think about it though..

Terry_VB_m 1/1/01   11:02 PM I know.  I thought you were serious at first,
                                  but I was only joking around.  Then it kind of
                                  just snowballed.  I guess we'll see how we
                                  click when we meet.

Sharon K   1/1/01   11:03 PM I guess.. NO I was not serious at all.. I was
                                  kidding.. I thought she was too a matter of
                                  fact

Sharon K   1/1/01   11:03 PM it would really just be like having a roomie
                                  huh??

Sharon K   1/1/01   11:03 PM kinda odd LOLOLOL

Terry_VB_m 1/1/01   11:03 PM I guess the part of me that believes you
                                  should only say "I do" if you truly mean you
                                  do for the rest of your life thinks it's not a
                                  right thing to do.

Sharon K   1/1/01   11:03 PM I met my wife on gay.com

Terry_VB_m 1/1/01   11:03 PM You did?  That's sweet.

Sharon K   1/1/01   11:04 PM yes, I know what you mean.. 

Sharon K   1/1/01   11:04 PM ya I am sweet *S*S*S* but you already knew
                                  that 

Terry_VB_m 1/1/01   11:05 PM right.  Hon, I'm your advocate, remember?

Terry_VB_m 1/1/01   11:05 PM Your #1 fan

Sharon K   1/1/01   11:06 PM yes... I know.. and I am yours as well..
                                  
                                  so what is the scoop on the new man in your
                                  life?? is he funny?

Terry_VB_m 1/1/01   11:06 PM No.  He's very sweet.

Sharon K   1/1/01   11:06 PM my g/f and I went to a party at the club last
                                  night.. I saw lots of cutie boys there.. and
                                  told her.. oh he is cute for my Terry.. she
                                  just laughed at me..

Sharon K   1/1/01   11:07 PM he is not funny?
                                  
                                  

Terry_VB_m 1/1/01   11:07 PM LOL!  I love you, Sharon.

Sharon K   1/1/01   11:07 PM *serious look*

Terry_VB_m 1/1/01   11:07 PM No, he's not funny.  I wish he made me laugh.

Sharon K   1/1/01   11:07 PM ya... I could not do that.. 

Terry_VB_m 1/1/01   11:07 PM maybe that's why I don't think he's "the one."

Sharon K   1/1/01   11:07 PM sounds silly.. but I have to be able to laugh

Sharon K   1/1/01   11:07 PM that would do it LOLOL

Terry_VB_m 1/1/01   11:08 PM He just seems too serious all the time.

Sharon K   1/1/01   11:08 PM well, this is new.. so you will have to see..
                                  does he atleast laugh when you say something
                                  funny hehehehe

Sharon K   1/1/01   11:08 PM dont make me slap him LOL

Terry_VB_m 1/1/01   11:09 PM He doesn't bring the best out of me like you
                                  do.  I mean he laughs, but it's not a
                                  encouraging laugh.

Terry_VB_m 1/1/01   11:09 PM Does that make sense?

Sharon K   1/1/01   11:10 PM yes I do know exactly what you mean.. Lora is
                                  not really funny..but she just glows when I
                                  goof off..

Terry_VB_m 1/1/01   11:11 PM Is that your girlfriend?

Sharon K   1/1/01   11:11 PM yes

Terry_VB_m 1/1/01   11:11 PM K.

Sharon K   1/1/01   11:11 PM she is a great friend most of all.. that is
                                  something I have always wished for..

Sharon K   1/1/01   11:12 PM I am just me these days.. and if anyone were
                                  to want to CHANGE me.. well they could sure
                                  kiss my hiney 

Terry_VB_m 1/1/01   11:12 PM I met a guy yesterday online that just seemed
                                  too perfect to be true.  He lives in Seattle,
                                  though.  He was just in town for a week
                                  visiting relatives.

Sharon K   1/1/01   11:12 PM did you meet him in person??

Terry_VB_m 1/1/01   11:13 PM Yes, tonight.  He dropped by after he went to
                                  a friend's house.  You know Sharon, I've met a
                                  lot of guys (total strangers before) and don't
                                  remember ever being this nervous about meeting
                                  someone.

Terry_VB_m 1/1/01   11:14 PM BUT...when he came to my room so we could
                                  talk, I just opened right up like I always do.
                                   We had a great conversation for 30 minutes or
                                  so, but then he had to leave.

Sharon K   1/1/01   11:14 PM just be careful.. and remember all the shit
                                  that goes on with a new relationship and the
                                  extra challenges of a long distance one..

Terry_VB_m 1/1/01   11:14 PM I would never do a LDR again.  Too hard, but
                                  most of all, unrealistic.

Sharon K   1/1/01   11:14 PM *sideways look* 
                                  
                                  a boy in your room.. hm
                                  tsk tsk

Sharon K   1/1/01   11:15 PM yes it is unrealistic.. I did it for over a
                                  year.. and then went to OZ... *sigh*
                                  
                                  

Terry_VB_m 1/1/01   11:15 PM he was in a chair... but b4 he came over, he
                                  didn't eliminate the possiblity of sex.  It
                                  didn't happen, though.  Not sure if it's
                                  because he wasn't interested or I was just
                                  content talking with him...but it didn't.

Sharon K   1/1/01   11:16 PM hm..
                                  
                                  well heck.. you boys just go and have sex
                                  fast... sheesh

Terry_VB_m 1/1/01   11:16 PM I know.  Well, he is a big bottom and he liked
                                  the looks of Mr. Happy.

Terry_VB_m 1/1/01   11:16 PM LOL

Sharon K   1/1/01   11:17 PM LOLOLOL
                                  
                                  *covering eyes*

Terry_VB_m 1/1/01   11:18 PM He wouldn't interest you... Oh, btw, there's
                                  this incredible guy I met Christmas day from
                                  Santa Cruz (he was in GA visiting relatives)
                                  Just incredible!  Cute, smart (going for his
                                  Ph.D.), you would not have believed the body
                                  this guy had.  He's thin, but below the belt:
                                  LOOKOUT!

Terry_VB_m 1/1/01   11:19 PM and this guy makes me laugh, too much like the
                                  one I met tonight.

Sharon K   1/1/01   11:20 PM OMG...

Sharon K   1/1/01   11:20 PM OMG.. well below the belt.. HELP LOLOL

Terry_VB_m 1/1/01   11:21 PM I mean can you say "endowed?"

Sharon K   1/1/01   11:21 PM you should not be knowing those things so fast
                                  about ppl.. sheesh

Sharon K   1/1/01   11:21 PM does nothing for me.. but... I suppose it
                                  would make me laugh *G*

Terry_VB_m 1/1/01   11:22 PM No laughing here.  Kinda like *jaw drops* 
                                  Whoa!

Sharon K   1/1/01   11:22 PM LOL.. still does nothing for me hon..
                                  *giggling*

Terry_VB_m 1/1/01   11:22 PM I know.  However, if you were a stra8 woman or
                                  a gay man, you would REALLY appreciate this
                                  picture I charmed him out of.

Sharon K   1/1/01   11:23 PM Oh good.. I am glad it was just a picture..
                                  sheesh

Sharon K   1/1/01   11:23 PM I thought you "Knew" what you were talking
                                  about..

Terry_VB_m 1/1/01   11:24 PM Oh yeah!  He was in Atlanta.  Nah, he's back
                                  in Santa Cruz now.  He's got a boyfriend, too.
                                   I told him I'd wait a lifetime if I had to to
                                  find someone like him.

Sharon K   1/1/01   11:24 PM hehehe well gives you somethin to think about
                                  hey?

Terry_VB_m 1/1/01   11:25 PM Yeah, it's just so hard when i meet these
                                  types of guys that I dream of meeting and
                                  falling in love with and they either a) are
                                  already involved, or b) not the least bit
                                  attracted to me.

Sharon K   1/1/01   11:26 PM well, ya know.. you will fall in  love with
                                  someone accidenly hon. it happens that way..
                                  when you look for it or wait for it .. it does
                                  not happen like that..

Terry_VB_m 1/1/01   11:27 PM I totally understand and agree with that. 
                                  It's accidental that I'm meeting these guys
                                  that I'm meeting.  It's usually when I go in
                                  as a monitor in another room that I meet them.
                                   It's not that I am on dating services, etc.
                                  looking for love.

Terry_VB_m 1/1/01   11:28 PM It seems the only guys that are attracted to
                                  me are guys I'm not attracted to.  It may be
                                  my insecurities that keep the ones I do want
                                  from wanting me.

Sharon K   1/1/01   11:29 PM I totally understand what you are saying
                                  there.. that is part of growing within
                                  yourself though.. no worries.. it happens when
                                  it is suppose to

                                  are allowed to use what we have learned to go
                                  further into the purpose we are here for..

Terry_VB_m 1/1/01   11:31 PM How long does he have to be there?

                                  him on the last Saturday of each month

Sharon K   1/1/01   11:34 PM it seems he may be there 6 months and then a
                                  rehab center..

Sharon K   1/1/01   11:35 PM uh huh

                                  haven't been in the best mood today.

                                  was 12/21 the last time we spoke.

Sharon K   1/1/01   11:41 PM I really have not been in the best space.. 

Sharon K   1/1/01   11:41 PM I just sit and watch the tv usually after
                                  everyone goes to bed.. 

Terry_VB_m 1/1/01   11:42 PM I just miss you.  Talking to you means a lot
                                  to me.

Terry_VB_m 1/1/01   11:43 PM I truly meant everything I said in that email.
                                   I've incredibly fortunate to have met you. 
                                  I'm really glad we clicked like we did.  I
                                  haven't formed a relationship that I consider
                                  as special as yours and mine.

Sharon K   1/1/01   11:44 PM we are in some form soul mates I believe..

Terry_VB_m 1/1/01   11:45 PM There's a blank about 3/4 of the way down
                                  where they need to paste the uniform.

                                  then below that information you have the blank
                                  to add your uniform.  When you're done, you
                                  click update.  Other than that, i don't know
                                  what you need to know.

Sharon K   1/4/01   10:15 PM no

Terry_VB_m 1/4/01   10:15 PM Well, he was my first love.

Sharon K   1/4/01   10:16 PM oh

Terry_VB_m 1/4/01   10:16 PM We dated almost a year and I lived here and he
                                  lived in PA.  I met him while he was working
                                  in Richmond (he was visiting his relatives
                                  here in VB and we met on gay.com for a
                                  hookup).  Well, the hookup turned into the
                                  most passionate 8 hours of sex I've ever had.

Sharon K   1/4/01   10:17 PM uh huh

Terry_VB_m 1/4/01   10:17 PM We did the LDR for awhile, my driving to PA a
                                  lot for 3 day weekends and such.

Sharon K   1/4/01   10:17 PM ok

Sharon K   1/4/01   10:17 PM listening

Terry_VB_m 1/4/01   10:17 PM My lease was up at the end of April of 2000
                                  and I had to make a choice: either move to PA
                                  to live with him or renew my lease and stay
                                  another year.  I didn't think I could last
                                  another year apart so I decided I'd move to
                                  PA.

Sharon K   1/4/01   10:18 PM ok.. listening

Terry_VB_m 1/4/01   10:19 PM I was going to quit my job but decided to come
                                  up with a story to get them to approve a leave
                                  of absence.  I told them that I had to move
                                  back home to WV to pay off my credit cards b/c
                                  I just couldn't make it down here.  

Terry_VB_m 1/4/01   10:20 PM Well, they approved the LOA, but that wasn't
                                  the biggest problem I had to deal with.  I had
                                  to come out to my mom b/c I was moving to PA. 
                                  I did that in March of 2000.  That was the
                                  hardest thing I think I've ever had to do in
                                  my life.  Then I came out to my family that
                                  lives here in VB (they took it better than
                                  expected).

Terry_VB_m 1/4/01   10:20 PM So off to Dubois, PA I went.  I didn't like
                                  the area that I was moving to.  I called it
                                  (Mayberry with a mall).  That's basically what
                                  it was.  I was going from a town of 500,000
                                  people to a County with 8,000 people.

Sharon K   1/4/01   10:21 PM oh goodness

Terry_VB_m 1/4/01   10:21 PM He knew I didn't want to live there, but he
                                  knew I didn't want to live without him.  Well,
                                  I moved up there in April of 2000.  I had been
                                  there 2 weeks (without a job).  I had resumes
                                  in with several companies and my application
                                  at the employment office.

Terry_VB_m 1/4/01   10:22 PM but I spent my time painting his new house and
                                  basically being a domestic.  I hated it!  I
                                  didn't go out because I had nowhere to go or
                                  no reason to go there.

Sharon K   1/4/01   10:22 PM hard adjustments hon

Terry_VB_m 1/4/01   10:23 PM I would stay up all night talking online to
                                  people in PA.  I met this guy named Dave that
                                  I talked with online.  He was telling me how
                                  his ex used to beat him, etc.  I felt bad for
                                  him so I called him on the phone.  This was
                                  like at 4:30 a.m. on the Saturday before
                                  Easter.

Sharon K   1/4/01   10:23 PM hm

Terry_VB_m 1/4/01   10:24 PM Well, I was talking to him about how I
                                  resented Buddy (my ex) for letting me quit my
                                  job (that I loved), come out to my family, and
                                  move there (without a job).  Well, Buddy was
                                  in the hallway eaves dropping on the
                                  conversation.

Sharon K   1/4/01   10:25 PM oh heavens.. those are things you should have
                                  been able to speak with him about. I imagine
                                  he was very hurt

Terry_VB_m 1/4/01   10:25 PM I went to bed around 5ish.  I knew that
                                  something was wrong because when I put my arm
                                  around Buddy he didn't move.  Until that
                                  night, he had always awakened when I would get
                                  in bed (no matter how late).

Terry_VB_m 1/4/01   10:25 PM Well, we didn't really communicate.  I'll get
                                  to that part here in a minute.

Sharon K   1/4/01   10:26 PM ok

Terry_VB_m 1/4/01   10:27 PM Then, around 7 a.m. on Easter Sunday I woke up
                                  and Buddy wasn't in bed.  I got up and went in
                                  the living room and there he was on the couch.
                                   I tried to talk to him but he just laid
                                  there.  I remember telling him, "Buddy, no
                                  matter what it is, please come back to bed." 
                                  Well, he didn't.  I ended up sleeping in until
                                  4 p.m. that Sunday b/c I was exhausted.

Sharon K   1/4/01   10:27 PM uh huh

Terry_VB_m 1/4/01   10:27 PM We were supposed to go to his friend Pearl's
                                  house for Easter dinner, but he blamed me b/c
                                  I slept in.  He could've awakened me.

Sharon K   1/4/01   10:27 PM how old is he?

Terry_VB_m 1/4/01   10:27 PM 29 now.

Sharon K   1/4/01   10:27 PM a baby too?? hehe

Sharon K   1/4/01   10:28 PM aw ok 

Terry_VB_m 1/4/01   10:28 PM Anyway, to make a VERY long story shorter, we
                                  made up for the time being (or so I thought). 
                                  We had as passionate of sex as we ever had the
                                  next night.  Then the following morning he
                                  sends me an email from work telling me that he
                                  thinks that I should move back to VB because
                                  I'm not happy.

Sharon K   1/4/01   10:29 PM oh, that must have been tough for him

Terry_VB_m 1/4/01   10:29 PM Tough for him?  I am the one who quit my job
                                  and moved 8 hours away for him!

Terry_VB_m 1/4/01   10:30 PM Well, the next day he came home from work and
                                  I finally got him to turn the fkn TV off long
                                  enough to talk. I asked him what he wanted me
                                  to do?  Did he want me to stay until I could
                                  save up enough $$ to move back?  Did he want
                                  me to go now?  He kept replying "I don't
                                  know."  That's all he would say.

Sharon K   1/4/01   10:31 PM aw

Terry_VB_m 1/4/01   10:31 PM I kept pressuring him for an answer.  He
                                  finally started crying.  I asked him what was
                                  wrong.  He wouldn't say.  Then I told him we
                                  should go lie down so I could hold him.  Well,
                                  we go to the bedroom and I'm holding him.  He
                                  starts crying more.

Sharon K   1/4/01   10:32 PM oh my.. so sad honey

Terry_VB_m 1/4/01   10:33 PM I ask him what's wrong.  He says "I don't
                                  know."  I asked, "Do you not love me anymore?"
                                  He said, "It's not that."  I said, "Are you in
                                  love with someone else?" He said, "No. Worse."
                                   I said, "What?"  He said, "The week before
                                  you moved up here, I met a guy online and we
                                  had sex."

Sharon K   1/4/01   10:34 PM OMFG

Terry_VB_m 1/4/01   10:34 PM I tried to brush it off and pretend not to be
                                  shocked.

Terry_VB_m 1/4/01   10:34 PM I even told him, "That's alright.  You're
                                  human."

Sharon K   1/4/01   10:34 PM k

Terry_VB_m 1/4/01   10:34 PM I even asked him how big the guy's dick was.

Terry_VB_m 1/4/01   10:34 PM *S*

Sharon K   1/4/01   10:35 PM *covering eyes*
                                  
                                  do you guys really ask eachother that??

Terry_VB_m 1/4/01   10:35 PM LOL  Yup

Terry_VB_m 1/4/01   10:35 PM I do.  But that may just be b/c I'm a size
                                  queen.

Sharon K   1/4/01   10:35 PM no way HAHAHAHA

Sharon K   1/4/01   10:35 PM LOL is that a word??

Sharon K   1/4/01   10:35 PM ROTFLMAO

Terry_VB_m 1/4/01   10:35 PM Anyway.  The next day we had the most
                                  incredible sex that we ever had.

Sharon K   1/4/01   10:35 PM I have learned so much since merging with the
                                  mens side

Sharon K   1/4/01   10:36 PM ok

Terry_VB_m 1/4/01   10:36 PM LOL... I bet.

Terry_VB_m 1/4/01   10:36 PM We were supposed to drive back to VB to get
                                  the rest of my things.  He didnt' want to go. 
                                  I had already made my mind up that I was going
                                  to move back to VB.  I couldn't trust him. 
                                  Everything he said to me, I doubted.

Terry_VB_m 1/4/01   10:37 PM I was going to stay there until I could at
                                  least save up enough $$ to get my own apt
                                  again.

Sharon K   1/4/01   10:37 PM and?

Terry_VB_m 1/4/01   10:38 PM Well, I took my clothes, my computer (just
                                  what I had to take to maintain for a week or
                                  so in VB).  That morning though, I talked to
                                  his best friend online and told her about how
                                  Buddy had cheated on me and that I was going
                                  to move back to VB (meaning when I saved up
                                  enough $$).  Well that night when I got home
                                  to VB, I called Buddy and he acted as though
                                  everything was fine.

Terry_VB_m 1/4/01   10:38 PM Later that night, I got online and he was
                                  there (it was really late).  I said, "I see
                                  you stay up late when I'm not there."  Well he
                                  came back with a really rude response.  Then
                                  he told me that he heard I wasn't coming back
                                  to PA.  That fkn fat cow Pearl (his friend)
                                  told him I wasn't coming back.

Terry_VB_m 1/4/01   10:39 PM I told him that I had total intentions of
                                  coming back and that I only took enough
                                  clothes to last me a week or so.

Terry_VB_m 1/4/01   10:40 PM but he was really rude to me and told me that
                                  he had been depressed because he thought I
                                  wasn't coming back and he had the guy over
                                  that he slept with the week b4 I moved again
                                  and they had sex again.  This time he told me
                                  they had anal sex (which Buddy had only done
                                  with me).

Terry_VB_m 1/4/01   10:40 PM He was just looking for a way to hurt me
                                  (which it did).  I cried all night long.  I
                                  literally cried myself to sleep holding the
                                  teddy bear that he had bought me for
                                  Valentine's Day.

Terry_VB_m 1/4/01   10:41 PM The next day I get an email from him telling
                                  me that he doesn't want me to come back to PA
                                  that he would "mail my things to me."  He said
                                  he just didn't think he could deal with me
                                  right now.

Terry_VB_m 1/4/01   10:41 PM I was devastated.  I didn't know what I was
                                  going to do.  My lease at my apt was up in 2
                                  days, I had a house full of stuff, no money
                                  because I had used up all my $$ paying my
                                  bills and travelling back and forth.

Terry_VB_m 1/4/01   10:42 PM I didn't know where I was going to live...I
                                  didn't know what I was going to do for a job
                                  (I had just taken a LOA 2 weeks before).

Sharon K   1/4/01   10:42 PM gawd

Terry_VB_m 1/4/01   10:42 PM I was SCARED TO DEATH.  I remember crying on
                                  the phone with my aunt telling her "I don't
                                  have anywhere to live.  I can't move back to
                                  WV because I can't make my bills on a salary
                                  there.  I can't stay here in this apt because
                                  I don't have enough $$ to pay May's rent."

Terry_VB_m 1/4/01   10:43 PM She told me, "well you can just come right
                                  over here and stay until you can get back on
                                  your feet."  Which would be why she is living
                                  here with me now.  I still feel obligated
                                  because she gave me a place to stay when I had
                                  nowhere to go.

Sharon K   1/4/01   10:44 PM awwwwwwww

Terry_VB_m 1/4/01   10:45 PM In 8 years I had never bounced a single check.
                                   I had 2 that went over my funds.  Thank God
                                  my bank covered them.

Terry_VB_m 1/4/01   10:45 PM It took me 3 months to get back to where I
                                  didn't have to keep asking my brother for $$.

Terry_VB_m 1/4/01   10:46 PM Such a humbling experience that was.  In spite
                                  of all that, can you believe I let my ex come
                                  spend Thanksgiving with my family b/c his dad
                                  was mad at him for dating another guy?

Sharon K   1/4/01   10:46 PM no, I cannot 

Sharon K   1/4/01   10:46 PM but, you are a wonderful caring person *G*

Terry_VB_m 1/4/01   10:47 PM I know.  I think if the sex hadn't have been
                                  as great as it was, I wouldn't have let him
                                  come down.

Sharon K   1/4/01   10:50 PM well, that is something that comes with age
                                  and relationships hon.. you are still just a
                                  baby

Terry_VB_m 1/4/01   10:51 PM yeah yeah, Mom.  Why don't you find me a nice
                                  cute boy that thinks I'm attractive.  That can
                                  be your New Year's resolution.

Sharon K   1/4/01   10:51 PM I would rather find you a nice man who loves
                                  you for yourself

Terry_VB_m 1/4/01   10:51 PM Well, he has to find me attractive, too

Sharon K   1/4/01   10:52 PM thinking.. he will think you are the most
                                  wonderful everything if he really loves you
                                  *S*

Terry_VB_m 1/4/01   10:52 PM and he has to be able to make me laugh.  Oh,
                                  and he needs to be intelligent.

Sharon K   1/4/01   10:52 PM yes on all of those as well.. 

Terry_VB_m 1/4/01   10:52 PM If you can find that man, I'll be ever
                                  grateful

Terry_VB_m 1/4/01   11:03 PM must've been.  So nice to know this stuff.

Terry_VB_m 1/4/01   11:08 PM Are you sure there's nothing wrong with the
                                  site?  I still am having a hard time getting
                                  to anything.  It's S-L-O-W!

Sharon K   1/4/01   11:09 PM I am getting all kinds of ICQ right now saying

Terry_VB_m 1/8/01   11:36 PM Well, this one lives in Richmond (about an
                                  hour and a half) from me.

Sharon K   1/8/01   11:36 PM well, that is a huge plus..
                                  
                                  I saw your other woman tonight *S* hehe

Terry_VB_m 1/8/01   11:37 PM I haven't seen her online since she was here.

Terry_VB_m 1/8/01   11:37 PM I don't think I'm going to go through with
                                  marrying her.  I haven't broken this to her
                                  yet, though.

Sharon K   1/8/01   11:37 PM she has been on alot.. just at different
                                  times..

Sharon K   1/8/01   11:37 PM ya.. I know what you mean.. 

Sharon K   1/8/01   11:37 PM I love ya anyways honey *S*

Sharon K   1/8/01   11:38 PM Smooooch

Terry_VB_m 1/8/01   11:38 PM Well, the reason I made this decision was not
                                  meeting her or anything.  She sent me an email
                                  that she sent to Ellen.  I don't get good
                                  vibes about it.

Sharon K   1/8/01   11:38 PM ohhhhhhhh hm.. 

Sharon K   1/8/01   11:38 PM what ya mean??

Sharon K   1/8/01   11:38 PM like in that they are not doing well??

Terry_VB_m 1/8/01   11:38 PM It doesn't sound to me like they're going to
                                  be together long.  It sounds to me like Ellen
                                  isn't in love anymore.

Sharon K   1/8/01   11:39 PM oh, she was saying something to me last night
                                  about worries she has

Sharon K   1/8/01   11:39 PM that ellen doesn;t love her anymore 

Terry_VB_m 1/8/01   11:39 PM Very valid if everything she said in the email
                                  is true.

Terry_VB_m 1/8/01   11:39 PM Do you think that guy is cute?

Terry_VB_m 1/8/01   11:40 PM the one whose link I sent you?

Sharon K   1/8/01   11:40 PM she said she thinks it is her weight.. she has
                                  gained alot of weight.. she said that ellen
                                  still loves her

Sharon K   1/8/01   11:40 PM Lemme look.. I have 4 windows open hon

Terry_VB_m 1/8/01   11:41 PM Ah, so baby must not have had so much back at

Terry_VB_m 1/8/01   11:42 PM really cute.

Terry_VB_m 1/8/01   11:42 PM He's all about me.

Sharon K   1/8/01   11:42 PM wow.great *S*

Terry_VB_m 1/8/01   11:42 PM I dunno

Sharon K   1/8/01   11:42 PM about Spence.. one thing I think is cool.. is
                                  that she wants to live in the states anyways..

Sharon K   1/8/01   11:43 PM but marrying her off.. well that is drastic

Terry_VB_m 1/8/01   11:43 PM True. I just wish she could transfer down with
                                  her job.

Sharon K   1/8/01   11:43 PM yes, I know..

Sharon K   1/8/01   11:44 PM it will be interesting to see what happens
                                  with her and ellen.. and how she feels about
                                  moving to the states when that calms

Sharon K   1/8/01   11:45 PM did you look at your boys pics on his page?

Sharon K   1/8/01   11:45 PM *slapping myself in da head*

                                  man to change the oil."

Sharon K   1/8/01   11:47 PM ROTFLMAO.. hahahah

Terry_VB_m 1/8/01   11:48 PM Well, you know I don't like to do that kind of
                                  stuff.

Sharon K   1/8/01   11:53 PM LOLOL 

Terry_VB_m 1/8/01   11:56 PM Do you want to read the email from Spence to
                                  Ellen that she sent me?

Sharon K   1/8/01   11:56 PM well, dont get dramatic with him mister

Sharon K   1/8/01   11:56 PM yes.. please..

Terry_VB_m 1/8/01   11:56 PM Yikes.  I really don't like bisexual men.

Sharon K   1/8/01   11:57 PM ya, I never like bi women either.. too big of
                                  a chance they will go either way..

Sharon K   1/8/01   11:57 PM my son once told me bi's are greedy LOL they
                                  want it all.. he also said.. hey mom.. do you

                                  land.. LOL

Terry_VB_m 1/8/01   11:58 PM Oh, Lord!

Sharon K   1/8/01   11:58 PM heheheheheh good hey?

Terry_VB_m 1/8/01   11:58 PM But I agree with him.  I believe they want to
                                  have their cake and eat it, too.  Much like
                                  married men who claim to be straight.

Sharon K   1/9/01   12:00 AM yup..

                                  about the bi thing.  Look out!

Sharon K   1/9/01   12:32 AM *smile*
                                  

Terry_VB_m 1/9/01   12:36 AM VBTerry23: It's hard to explain, and I know
                                  that there are a lot of gay men that totally
                                  despise bisexuals (for whatever reason), but I
                                  am not one of them.
                                  VBTerry23: It scares me
                                  VBTerry23: to put it plain and simple
                                  VBTerry23: but it's a silly fear
                                  bronc079: is that what you wanted to say
                                  VBTerry23: not done
                                  VBTerry23: :-D

Terry_VB_m 1/9/01   12:37 AM VBTerry23: Even though it scares me (the fear
                                  of you or whoever deciding he wants the
                                  opposite sex), he could very well decide to
                                  leave me for another man.

Terry_VB_m 1/9/01   12:37 AM How do you think I did?

Sharon K   1/9/01   12:37 AM bravo

Terry_VB_m 1/9/01   12:39 AM *bows and waves to the crowd* Thank you! Thank

                                  to work.

Sharon K   1/9/01   12:49 AM yes.. you have had a bit of time off lately
                                  hon

                                  don't blame you for not wanting to get caught
                                  up in the Spence things.. seems odd

Terry_VB_m 1/9/01   12:55 AM Didn't that email take you by surprise?

Sharon K   1/9/01   12:55 AM no kidding.. 

Sharon K   1/9/01   12:56 AM it is like there are too many questions on
                                  it.. like it is a relationship that just is
                                  not working and Spence would do about anything
                                  to get there and PROVE her love..tis sad

Sharon K   1/9/01   12:56 AM she really loves her

Sharon K   1/9/01   12:56 AM and would do anything to be with her.. is that
                                  what you got from it?

Terry_VB_m 1/9/01   12:56 AM Yes, she seems to

Terry_VB_m 1/9/01   12:56 AM and yeah.

Terry_VB_m 1/9/01   1:00 AM  This bisexual thing has kind of thrown up a
                                  wall between Jeff and myself.

Sharon K   1/9/01   1:01 AM  well, maybe he is protective of it.. but it is
                                  an issue for you..so good for you for bringing
                                  it up hon

Terry_VB_m 1/9/01   1:02 AM  He actually brought it up.  I think he really
                                  likes me.

Sharon K   1/9/01   1:03 AM  *S*S*S*S

Terry_VB_m 1/9/01   1:03 AM  Have you seen Miss Congeniality?

Sharon K   1/9/01   1:04 AM  no

Terry_VB_m 1/9/01   1:05 AM  It's a very funny movie.... anyway, there's
                                  one part where Sandra Bullock is close to
                                  Benjamin Bratt and she's kinda singing to him,
                                  "I think you like me, you wanna hug me, you
                                  wanna kiss me."  I was kinda singing that to
                                  him on the phone last night.

Sharon K   1/9/01   1:07 AM  awwwwwwwww soooooooo sweet. awwwwww shucks

Terry_VB_m 1/9/01   1:08 AM  You'd have to see the movie to appreciate how
                                  she sings it.

Sharon K   1/9/01   1:09 AM  ok, I will see da movie.. damn I am easy to

                                  because I'm tired of those parasites that I
                                  have no power against.

Terry_VB_m 1/9/01   11:09 PM #2 Online action reports are not very user
                                  friendly with Netscape version 6.0

Terry_VB_m 1/9/01   11:10 PM #3 Where are all the monitors?

Terry_VB_m 1/9/01   11:10 PM I have not seen another monitor on my floor
                                  (or most of the floors) when I'm monitoring in
                                  QUITE some time.

Terry_VB_m 1/9/01   11:11 PM They need to raise the amount of time that we
                                  are required to volunteer.  4 hours is NOT
                                  that much time to volunteer.

Terry_VB_m 1/9/01   11:12 PM and that's just my preliminary list.  I
                                  usually come up with a lot more during the
                                  meeting.

Sharon K   1/9/01   11:12 PM we are waiting for the site to get stable..
                                  then we can add monitors.. and this meeting is
                                  mandatory responce.. and there are many that
                                  are not answering, sl they will get let go..
                                  and then it will show we need ppl...
                                  
                                  

Terry_VB_m 1/9/01   11:13 PM Yes, I've heard that.  How long does it take
                                  for the site to get stable?  We haven't had
                                  any new monitors on the Men's floor since
                                  July.

Terry_VB_m 1/9/01   11:14 PM The chatters are getting frustrated and taking
                                  it out on me.  They say I'm one of the ONLY
                                  ones they see.

Terry_VB_m 1/9/01   11:16 PM Ah, we go the upgrade.

Sharon K   1/9/01   11:16 PM ahhhhhhh

Sharon K   1/9/01   11:16 PM how are you feeling??

Terry_VB_m 1/9/01   11:17 PM better...my eyes are still burning so I
                                  probably am running a temp.

Terry_VB_m 1/9/01   11:17 PM I didn't go to the doctors today, either

Sharon K   1/9/01   11:17 PM did you go to work today?

Sharon K   1/9/01   11:17 PM you really should geez.. you have not been
                                  well for some time now..

Terry_VB_m 1/9/01   11:17 PM No, didn't work today, but come hell or high
                                  water, I'll be there tomorrow...and probably
                                  until midnight.

Sharon K   1/9/01   11:18 PM oh heavens.. that will not help you if you are
                                  still sick darlin

Terry_VB_m 1/9/01   11:18 PM I know, but a man's gotta do what a man's
                                  gotta do.  I just need to find a man to do it
                                  for me.

Sharon K   1/9/01   11:19 PM LOLOL heavens.. hehehhehe

Terry_VB_m 1/9/01   11:19 PM My manager called me tonight @ 9 p.m. (I was
                                  sleeping) to tell me that she is sending me an
                                  outlook about some changes that she wants to
                                  take effect.  I'm like "oh, shit!"

Sharon K   1/9/01   11:22 PM oh my.. and what did that mean?

Terry_VB_m 1/9/01   11:23 PM I dont' have a clue.  I tried to call Alison,
                                  my friend from work, and she didn't know of
                                  any changes.  I'm sure I'll have 100 emails
                                  when I get into work tomorrow.  I already know
                                  I have 7 voice mails.  This is all from being
                                  off 2 days.  I usually get 40/50 emails in one
                                  day's time.

Terry_VB_m 1/9/01   11:24 PM brb

Terry_VB_m 1/9/01   11:25 PM back

Sharon K   1/9/01   11:26 PM ok heheh

Terry_VB_m 1/9/01   11:26 PM It sounded like out heat pump was messing up,
                                  but it's the neighbors.

Sharon K   1/9/01   11:27 PM oh cool.. 

Terry_VB_m 1/9/01   11:27 PM Yeah, I know.  I have enough problems.

Sharon K   1/9/01   11:30 PM no kidding.. poor lil thang

Terry_VB_m 1/9/01   11:30 PM my eyes are burning so bad.  fkn sinuses.

Sharon K   1/9/01   11:31 PM take a claritin.

Sharon K   1/9/01   11:31 PM it helps alot

Terry_VB_m 1/9/01   11:31 PM They dont' work.  Neither does Claritin D,
                                  Allegra, Allegra D, Flonase, Beconase, and a
                                  half dozen other.s

Sharon K   1/9/01   11:32 PM well then go to the doctors sheesh

Sharon K   1/9/01   11:32 PM damn.. stubborn men

Terry_VB_m 1/9/01   11:33 PM I wish she would just give me a standing order
                                  for antibiotics...but we had several people
                                  die here in the area for antibiotic
                                  resistence.

Sharon K   1/9/01   11:36 PM well, then you understand why you cannot have
                                  it.. 

Terry_VB_m 1/9/01   11:36 PM yes, mama Sharon

Sharon K   1/9/01   11:37 PM good answer.. *sideways look*

Terry_VB_m 1/9/01   11:37 PM lol

Terry_VB_m 1/9/01   11:38 PM Do you think I should bring up the issues I
                                  told you about?

Sharon K   1/9/01   11:39 PM alot of them will be covered.. they are items
                                  that ppl have sent in already for the
                                  agenda... 

Terry_VB_m 1/9/01   11:39 PM Good

Sharon K   1/9/01   11:39 PM I think one of the main things ppl want are
                                  monitors.. and by us getting to weed out the
                                  ones who do not respond we can get those slots
                                  filled.. 

Sharon K   1/9/01   11:40 PM do me a favor.. don't mention my name or
                                  anything.. BUT.. write to feedback... and tell
                                  them that we need more monitors.. 

Sharon K   1/9/01   11:40 PM if you have more than one addy.. not directley
                                  linked to you.. send em from there too *S*S*

Terry_VB_m 1/9/01   11:40 PM I didn't know that address was for anything
                                  like that

Sharon K   1/9/01   11:40 PM shhhhhhhhhhhh

Sharon K   1/9/01   11:40 PM don't tell anyone.. we are working around the
                                  system *S*S*S*S**S*

Terry_VB_m 1/9/01   11:40 PM Got it!

Sharon K   1/9/01   11:40 PM we found a backdoor *S*S*

Terry_VB_m 1/9/01   11:41 PM Do you think that'll make a difference?

Sharon K   1/9/01   11:41 PM uh huh.. from where we got the info.. yes.. 

Sharon K   1/9/01   11:41 PM you can pass along to others to send the req
                                  there as well.. just dont' mention us in it

Sharon K   1/9/01   11:41 PM *S*

Terry_VB_m 1/9/01   11:41 PM is it feedback@gay.com or
                                  feedback@onlinepartners.com ?
                                  

Sharon K   1/9/01   11:42 PM gay.com

Terry_VB_m 1/9/01   11:42 PM k

Terry_VB_m 1/9/01   11:55 PM Alright.  Letter sent.  I bcc'd you on it so
                                  you can see what I wrote. If I see another
                                  monitor (not likely), I'll tell them to do the
                                  same.  Should I tell regular chatters to do
                                  the same?

Sharon K   1/9/01   11:56 PM ok hon.. sounds great

Sharon K   1/9/01   11:56 PM I am not sure.. I will have to ask the other
                                  spies

                                  feedback@gay.com
                                  
                                  and shhhhhh don't tell anyone I sent you to
                                  that addy

Terry_VB_m 1/10/01  12:01 AM Honey, I have that email and I would never
                                  tell them.

Terry_VB_m 1/10/01  12:01 AM comes on here (ICQ)?

Sharon K   1/10/01  12:02 AM shell just said it was feedback@onlinepartners

Sharon K   1/10/01  12:02 AM ??

Sharon K   1/10/01  12:02 AM want me to check my email??

Terry_VB_m 1/10/01  12:02 AM I'll check my SENT.  I may have kept a
                                  previous one.

Sharon K   1/10/01  12:03 AM ok great.. I think they all route back to the
                                  same.. 

Terry_VB_m 1/10/01  12:08 AM We received a volunteer update from Puppet
                                  saying it was feedback@gay.com

Sharon K   1/10/01  12:08 AM that is what I thought... *S*

Terry_VB_m 1/10/01  12:09 AM Me, too.  We're the bomb.

Sharon K   1/10/01  12:09 AM I knew it was right.. well I thought i knew uh

Sharon K   1/10/01  12:09 AM ^5 yes we are.. are you monitoring??

Terry_VB_m 1/10/01  12:09 AM No.  I'm "over it."

Sharon K   1/10/01  12:10 AM oh are you. 

Terry_VB_m 1/10/01  12:10 AM I just feel sick and don't like monitoring
                                  when I don't feel well.  I get too irritated
                                  by the chatters.  That's when I usually get
                                  complaints.

Sharon K   1/10/01  12:10 AM and what is it?? the bi guy

Sharon K   1/10/01  12:10 AM oh ok *S*

Sharon K   1/10/01  12:10 AM I went to your floor looking for you last
                                  night I think it was

Terry_VB_m 1/10/01  12:10 AM No, he's not even paying attention to me
                                  *sighs*  He's on maps.com  

Sharon K   1/10/01  12:10 AM oh,, like in maps?? directional ones?

Sharon K   1/10/01  12:11 AM oh ya.. and I just loved the Invitation *S*

Terry_VB_m 1/10/01  12:11 AM yeah, he does criminal background checks for
                                  the dept. of defense.

Terry_VB_m 1/10/01  12:11 AM wasn't that cool?  I sent it out to my entire
                                  mailing list later and got several "thank
                                  you's"

Sharon K   1/10/01  12:12 AM yes, Thank you from me too *S*
                                  
                                  it was great.. 

Sharon K   1/10/01  12:12 AM that is a cool job to do

Terry_VB_m 1/10/01  12:13 AM Every once in awhile I send out mass emails. 
                                  I don't know why I didn't think to use the
                                  "bcc" before.  I was hesistent to send out
                                  mass emails to my aunt, other family, etc.
                                  with email addresses like
                                  bigcock12@yaddayadda.com

Sharon K   1/10/01  12:14 AM *spitting out soda*

Terry_VB_m 1/10/01  12:14 AM LOL!

Sharon K   1/10/01  12:14 AM shame on you.. lol

Sharon K   1/10/01  12:14 AM such a  nice thing and such a potty mouth name

Terry_VB_m 1/10/01  12:15 AM I don't have that email address. I'm just
                                  saying that I have people in my address book
                                  that have gay email addresses.  

Sharon K   1/10/01  12:15 AM ohhh ok lol.. I would not put it past you hehe

Sharon K   1/10/01  12:15 AM you boys have some interesting names that is
                                  for sure

Terry_VB_m 1/10/01  12:16 AM Good Lord, no!  That'd be false advertising.  

Sharon K   1/10/01  12:16 AM LOLOLOL

Terry_VB_m 1/10/01  12:17 AM My abs are hurting (a good thing).  My best
                                  friend Thomas has an ab slide thing and I did
                                  it for 3 minutes the last two days.  Ugh!

Sharon K   1/10/01  12:17 AM that is too much.. well I guess you know that
                                  now huh mister?? 

Terry_VB_m 1/10/01  12:18 AM Yeah, but I needed to do it, even though I
                                  felt like crap.  I haven't worked out in so
                                  long and I can really tell my ab muscles have
                                  deteriorated.  My back is actually starting to
                                  hurt as a result of it.

Terry_VB_m 1/10/01  12:27 AM Ok, I'm off to bed.

Sharon K   1/10/01  12:28 AM ok hon.. I will see you tom.. 

Terry_VB_m 1/10/01  12:28 AM Okie doke.

Sharon K   1/10/01  12:28 AM I am off work for the next two day S*S

Terry_VB_m 1/10/01  12:28 AM I CAN'T stay home.

Terry_VB_m 1/10/01  12:30 AM G'nite

Terry_VB_m 1/10/01  11:00 PM Where were you 10 minutes ago?  I was having a
                                  major blonde moment.

Sharon K   1/10/01  11:00 PM LOL, why are you having a blonde moment/?

Terry_VB_m 1/10/01  11:01 PM I didn't read the entire email from Puppet and
                                  didn't realize it had new passwords so I was
                                  trying to log on using the ones she sent the
                                  other day

Sharon K   1/10/01  11:01 PM *shaking head*

Sharon K   1/10/01  11:02 PM the floors are insane now haha

Terry_VB_m 1/10/01  11:02 PM I don't like having to click on identity to
                                  see someone's IP addy.  That's extra work. 
                                  You can count on my bitching on Saturday.

Sharon K   1/10/01  11:04 PM oh it is happening already...

Terry_VB_m 1/10/01  11:04 PM I'm sure it is.  Shouldn't they try to make
                                  our jobs easier?

Sharon K   1/10/01  11:05 PM uh huh... 

Terry_VB_m 1/10/01  11:06 PM I thought of something else I want to bring up
                                  at the meeting.  I think we should have access
                                  to how many hours we've volunteered during a
                                  month's time.  Also how many action reports
                                  we've done.  Kind of like a report card.  It
                                  could be located in My Account.   I'm sure
                                  they won't go for it, but I thought that would
                                  be cool

Terry_VB_m 1/10/01  11:08 PM They're going to keep making things worse and
                                  even I will stop volunteering.  

Sharon K   1/10/01  11:10 PM I am not sure, but I don't think anyone knew
                                  this was going to be apart of the new
                                  service...

Sharon K   1/10/01  11:10 PM from the emails I am reading now, it appears
                                  they are working on it

Terry_VB_m 1/10/01  11:11 PM Well, this is what Puppet said in that email
                                  "A new feature will be in the drop-down menu
                                  called "Identify." You must highlight a
                                  visitor's name and then click on "identify" in
                                  the people pull down to see IP addresses. This
                                  will prevent anyone without monitor authority
                                  from seeing IP ddresses."
                                  
                                  

Terry_VB_m 1/10/01  11:11 PM Who does she think is going to see it?

Sharon K   1/10/01  11:11 PM ya, well she saw it as it came out as well.. 

Sharon K   1/10/01  11:12 PM there are alot of ppl who come in through some

Terry_VB_m 1/10/01  11:12 PM Ah!  You mean there are chatters that are able
                                  to see IP addresses?

                                  track ppl from it..

                                  my friend

Sharon K   1/15/01  9:40 PM  Everything is a lesson the way I look at it..

Terry_VB_m 1/15/01  9:40 PM  right.  I guess it got my emotions stirring. 
                                  I was crying.

Sharon K   1/15/01  9:41 PM  well the night before last I finally broke
                                  down too.. I had so much stored up inside me

Sharon K   1/15/01  9:41 PM  I thought I was going to totally fall apart..
                                  it scared the hell out of me

Terry_VB_m 1/15/01  9:42 PM  Awwwwww

Sharon K   1/15/01  9:42 PM  it really was awful... I don't think I ever
                                  told you, as there are few ppl in my life now
                                  that know.. but I have had cancer 4 times in
                                  my life.. and I do know real fear and all of
                                  the things that go with it..

Terry_VB_m 1/15/01  9:43 PM  Wow!

Sharon K   1/15/01  9:43 PM  maybe that is where some of my "learned
                                  knowledge" comes from *S*

Terry_VB_m 1/15/01  9:43 PM  I'm sure it does.

Sharon K   1/15/01  9:45 PM  ya, so sometimes when I am not feeling well, I
                                  get a bit nervouse..

Sharon K   1/15/01  9:45 PM  I know what waiting on anything like that
                                  feels like.. you just have to do it is all

Sharon K   1/15/01  9:45 PM  I have been cancer free for almost 10 years
                                  now.. so... 

Sharon K   1/15/01  9:46 PM  *shrug*

Terry_VB_m 1/15/01  9:46 PM  I'm so proud

Terry_VB_m 1/15/01  9:46 PM  Thank God

Sharon K   1/15/01  9:47 PM  aw shucks.. yes Thank God.. it really did not
                                  do my belief in God much good when I kept
                                  getting sick.. now I have a so so belief

Terry_VB_m 1/15/01  9:48 PM  me, too

Sharon K   1/15/01  9:49 PM  ya, I know *Sigh*
                                  
                                  we just can do the best we can with what we
                                  have .. I think we are all tossed out there
                                  again to find a path.. to make a new one and
                                  in hopes that we run across something someone
                                  else missed..

Terry_VB_m 1/15/01  10:09 PM turkey sandwich/tater tots

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:09 PM the turkey sounds good..
                                  
                                  I made steak and potatoes.. we don't eat much
                                  red meat.. but it sure was good..

Terry_VB_m 1/15/01  10:12 PM Awww, Thank you.

Terry_VB_m 1/15/01  10:12 PM I figured you were laughing your ass off
                                  during the meeting.

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:13 PM I sure was *S*S* hehehehe thanks.. the TL&Pup
                                  stay in a chat in AIMS.. and we were just
                                  cracking up LOL

Terry_VB_m 1/15/01  10:14 PM I kept sending wise-ass remarks..some were
                                  posted, some weren't

Terry_VB_m 1/15/01  10:15 PM Spence was very upset that Puppet didn't post
                                  her question (at either meeting)

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:15 PM was she?? if you all only knew how many
                                  questions were being tossed at us..

Terry_VB_m 1/15/01  10:16 PM I'm sure.  I guess I'm lucky that the ones I
                                  asked got posted.

Terry_VB_m 1/15/01  10:16 PM I'm in good with the big dogs

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:16 PM I am not sure I remember her ??
                                  
                                  we did not post ones that we already gave the
                                  answer to.. or ones that we cover constantly
                                  in the emails or ones that are on the
                                  guidlines ALL the time

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:16 PM *S*S* yes you are.. 

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:16 PM heheheh shhhhhhh

Terry_VB_m 1/15/01  10:17 PM She asked about the threats she has gotten
                                  from Dykester...apparently, Puppet hasn't
                                  responded to any of her emails.  she emailed
                                  Jeff

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:17 PM really though.. if the questions were common
                                  sence.. we usually let them go unless a few
                                  ppl posted on them.. if we posted all of the
                                  comments we would have been there 10 hours

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:18 PM well, we did not answer specifc Questions on
                                  individual chatters..

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:18 PM they have gone over and over this with her..

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:18 PM I think her and dykester just need to leave
                                  eachother alone.. 

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:19 PM it is not something even the team leaders are
                                  allowed to intevine in anymore.. Jeff took
                                  charge of it long ago.. she knows that

Terry_VB_m 1/15/01  10:20 PM He took charge of what?

Terry_VB_m 1/15/01  10:20 PM her situation with this lady?

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:20 PM the Spence and dykester thing.. 

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:20 PM yes

Terry_VB_m 1/15/01  10:21 PM ah, so it's not a recent issue.

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:21 PM oh no.. it is months and months old

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:21 PM and pup has not been in.. she was at home
                                  running the meeting from her puter

Terry_VB_m 1/15/01  10:22 PM ah

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:22 PM brb

Terry_VB_m 1/15/01  10:22 PM ok

Terry_VB_m 1/15/01  10:30 PM la la la la la la 

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:31 PM Hi honey LOL was just on my floor taking care
                                  of some nasty thing

Terry_VB_m 1/15/01  10:31 PM Uh oh

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:31 PM oh well.. no worries..
                                  

Terry_VB_m 1/15/01  10:31 PM What's the deal with all the uproar among the
                                  monitors?

Terry_VB_m 1/15/01  10:32 PM HenkNL resigning....Sean_monitor thinking you
                                  guys kicked him out of the 8:00 meeting

Terry_VB_m 1/15/01  10:32 PM the anonymous email to Puppet.

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:32 PM paranoid ppl

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:33 PM she gets some emails like that.. this time she
                                  posted it on the boards I guess

Terry_VB_m 1/15/01  10:33 PM Do you agree with how she runs gay.com?

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:33 PM I am not sure what is wrong with Henk at all..

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:33 PM I understand alot I suppose..

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:33 PM she does what she is told.. ppl seem to forget
                                  that

Terry_VB_m 1/15/01  10:34 PM I have never had issues with her.

Terry_VB_m 1/15/01  10:34 PM I've always thought she did a bang-up job. I
                                  know I wouldn't want to do her job...unless
                                  she makes a lot of $$.

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:34 PM I think she does the best she can.

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:35 PM I don't think she makes enoght money.. I
                                  believe that if ppl are upset to the point of
                                  screaming and yelling and loosing sleep and
                                  all of that.. that they take a look at what is
                                  really bothering them in their life.. most
                                  likely it is not gay.com

Terry_VB_m 1/15/01  10:35 PM yeah, me too

Terry_VB_m 1/15/01  10:35 PM I agree

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:36 PM I can say.. that most all of the uproar is ppl
                                  were upset that they could not see eachohter
                                  in the meeting..

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:36 PM and to me that is childish

Terry_VB_m 1/15/01  10:36 PM I've never liked that, either.

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:36 PM I know

Terry_VB_m 1/15/01  10:36 PM but it's not a big issue to me

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:36 PM I can understand ppl not understaning it 

Terry_VB_m 1/15/01  10:36 PM I figure it's par for the course.

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:36 PM but if you saw all of the posts.. you would
                                  know why there could not be an open room
                                  

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:37 PM ppl are asking for their passwords in the
                                  middle of it.. changing their email addys.. 

Terry_VB_m 1/15/01  10:37 PM LOL

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:37 PM asking for the guidlines addy..

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:37 PM asking where to send action reports

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:37 PM LOLOLOL

Terry_VB_m 1/15/01  10:37 PM Sometimes I wonder about those people

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:37 PM it would be caos.. and it would take hours and
                                  hours for a meeting

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:37 PM it is a hoot however

Terry_VB_m 1/15/01  10:38 PM You know it.  I don't think there should be an
                                  open forum

Terry_VB_m 1/15/01  10:38 PM However, I agree that we should be able to
                                  cross chat in pvt.

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:38 PM well, that is why ppl are upset..

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:38 PM there is no way to set that up at this point..
                                  

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:38 PM and all monitors are always welcome to set a
                                  time and meet anyone they want..

Terry_VB_m 1/15/01  10:39 PM sometimes I wonder what the real limitations
                                  to volano chat are.

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:39 PM uh huh.. 
                                  

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:39 PM we are a big enough company to have good
                                  service 

Terry_VB_m 1/15/01  10:39 PM Yes, we are.

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:39 PM and we are not getting it.. whether it is
                                  Volcano or what.. I am not sure

Terry_VB_m 1/15/01  10:40 PM I miss a lot of the features IRC has.

Terry_VB_m 1/15/01  10:40 PM but overall, I like gay.com much better.

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:41 PM I use to talk on irc.. years ago now.. I don't
                                  even remember how it worked..I know I loved it
                                  there

Terry_VB_m 1/15/01  10:41 PM I went there the other day when gay.com was
                                  down.  It was like a deserted island.

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:42 PM aw.. well we do have the biggest chathouses..

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:42 PM I dunno.. I think it is too bad that ppl are
                                  resigning cuz they could not sit up there with
                                  us LOLOL

Terry_VB_m 1/15/01  10:42 PM and the best by far (and not just b/c you and
                                  I are monitors)

Terry_VB_m 1/15/01  10:43 PM It's a power thing.  They don't like you
                                  sitting up there like officers at a girlscout
                                  meeting.

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:43 PM the only thing diff.. sitting up where we do,
                                  is that we can see all of your posts.. we have
                                  no powers there

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:43 PM well, I am da troop leader LOLOL

Terry_VB_m 1/15/01  10:43 PM yes, you are

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:43 PM if they would have been there and would have
                                  been as great as me.. hehe they would be there
                                  as well..

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:44 PM ROTFLMAO

Terry_VB_m 1/15/01  10:44 PM right on!

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:44 PM it really is not that glorious of a job

Terry_VB_m 1/15/01  10:44 PM I know.  It can't be

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:44 PM *shrug*
                                  just is the way it is , that is all..
                                  
                                  

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:44 PM not one other woman offered any help to
                                  gay.com 

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:45 PM I asked if they needed help.. and Jeff said..
                                  oh thank you Sharon yes LOL

Terry_VB_m 1/15/01  10:45 PM help for what?

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:45 PM when the counsil was disbanned

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:45 PM with email ect.

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:45 PM I was on the old council.. 

Terry_VB_m 1/15/01  10:46 PM I've heard stories

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:46 PM so I had all the paper work.. just asked if
                                  they needed anything.. and that is how I got
                                  here.

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:46 PM ya, well we asked for it.. getting disbanned
                                  that is *G* hehehehe

Terry_VB_m 1/15/01  10:46 PM why?

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:47 PM ah.. well there were alot of ppl.. and alot of
                                  power players on it.. and most of the mens and
                                  womens team.. where ALWAYS bitching..

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:47 PM always..

Terry_VB_m 1/15/01  10:47 PM I think there should be a male version of
                                  Puppet.

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:47 PM and I think that Jeff and pup got too tired of
                                  it..

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:47 PM uh huh

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:47 PM I think in time there may be.. 

Terry_VB_m 1/15/01  10:48 PM I think it's hard for some of the men to
                                  accept a woman is at the top

Terry_VB_m 1/15/01  10:48 PM in charge

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:48 PM I just try to mind my biz for the most part..
                                  and just do what I enjoy doing 

Terry_VB_m 1/15/01  10:48 PM making the decisions

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:48 PM yes, well.. honestly..?????

Terry_VB_m 1/15/01  10:48 PM I know

Terry_VB_m 1/15/01  10:48 PM no brainer

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:48 PM you wanna hear my thought on that one?

Terry_VB_m 1/15/01  10:48 PM sure

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:48 PM No One asked them

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:48 PM *G*

Terry_VB_m 1/15/01  10:49 PM right

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:49 PM simple as that

                                  at too *G*

Terry_VB_m 1/15/01  10:53 PM But that's why we're great people.  We just
                                  let it roll right off our backs like water on
                                  a hen

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:54 PM yup yup

Terry_VB_m 1/15/01  10:55 PM I usually don't have too many issues with
                                  gay.com

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:55 PM yes I have noticed that.. *S*

Terry_VB_m 1/15/01  10:55 PM Like Puppet suggested, when I get frustrated,
                                  I shut it down.

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:55 PM lucky me *G*

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:55 PM yup.. that is what I do.. 

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:55 PM it is not too hard to get caught up in it
                                  sometimes though.. sometimes it just pisses ya
                                  off

Terry_VB_m 1/15/01  10:55 PM For the most part, I'm a team player. 
                                  Granted, I was a bit fascinated with the power
                                  at first (and got several complaints because
                                  of it), but I think everyone does that.

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:55 PM we just beg for things sometimes LOLOLOLOL

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:56 PM oh yes.. it happens to most

Terry_VB_m 1/15/01  10:56 PM Well, when you have this many raging queens
                                  all in one place, it's hard to keep one's
                                  sanity.

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:56 PM I hate getting cut and pastes from chatters
                                  with a monitor saying.. I am a monitor and you
                                  will LOLOLOL

Terry_VB_m 1/15/01  10:56 PM LOL!  

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:57 PM gosh.. we get them where montiors are cussing
                                  at chatters.. it is interesting to say the
                                  least 

Terry_VB_m 1/15/01  10:58 PM I'm not sure if I've ever cursed at a chatter

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:58 PM I am going to bed hon..

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:58 PM I have told one "for fuck sake" LOLOL

Terry_VB_m 1/15/01  10:58 PM But I have been like cartman from Southpark
                                  and said, "You will respect my authorita!" 
                                  Then banned them

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:58 PM whooooooo impressed *W*

                                  that said that.

Sharon K   1/15/01  10:59 PM lol

Sharon K   1/16/01  11:15 PM I am not happy they did that.. BUT.. he gets
                                  to go to a much less restrictive place now

Terry_VB_m 1/16/01  11:15 PM That's good.

Sharon K   1/16/01  11:15 PM they saw it within hours of sending him off

Sharon K   1/16/01  11:16 PM oh yes.. it  means treatment center compared
                                  to kiddy jail..

Sharon K   1/16/01  11:16 PM thank god.. I was so worried and sad

Sharon K   1/16/01  11:16 PM sooooooo sad

Terry_VB_m 1/16/01  11:16 PM I can imagine.

Sharon K   1/16/01  11:17 PM oh you really must cheer up..

Sharon K   1/16/01  11:17 PM I can feel it through the screen

Sharon K   1/16/01  11:17 PM *Smack*

Terry_VB_m 1/16/01  11:17 PM I don't know why I haven't snapped out of it. 
                                  I really don't want to go back on my meds. 
                                  I've been off of them since June.

Sharon K   1/16/01  11:18 PM well, it does not help that you let yourself
                                  stay ill so long darlin

Terry_VB_m 1/16/01  11:18 PM Well, I have taken so many different
                                  antibiotics, I'm sick of going to get more.

Terry_VB_m 1/16/01  11:18 PM I'm on them at least every other month

Terry_VB_m 1/16/01  11:19 PM plus, I need to start working out again.  

Sharon K   1/16/01  11:20 PM working out really does do wonders for a
                                  person

Sharon K   1/16/01  11:20 PM what meds were you on?

Terry_VB_m 1/16/01  11:20 PM Yeah, I know.  I've just got to make myself
                                  start working out again.

Terry_VB_m 1/16/01  11:20 PM Um, the last two were Serzone & Depakote.

Terry_VB_m 1/16/01  11:21 PM I was taking more drugs than a pusher.

Sharon K   1/16/01  11:21 PM I don't know Serzone

Sharon K   1/16/01  11:21 PM is it for depression?

Sharon K   1/16/01  11:21 PM if you will get through it don't take em
                                  again.. 

Terry_VB_m 1/16/01  11:22 PM Yes, Serzone & Depakote were to treat the
                                  bipolar disorder.

Sharon K   1/16/01  11:22 PM know what I mean.. and it takes so long for
                                  them to start working..
                                  
                                  I almost took myself to the doctor for drugs
                                  the other day

Sharon K   1/16/01  11:22 PM have you tried Lithum??

Terry_VB_m 1/16/01  11:22 PM I haven't tried that one.

Sharon K   1/16/01  11:22 PM Eskalith is the best.. a combo of Esk.. and
                                  dep.. is a good one

Terry_VB_m 1/16/01  11:23 PM I've been on Wellbutrin, Zoloft, Paxil,
                                  Prozac, Depakote, Serzone...and I can't
                                  remember what else.

Sharon K   1/16/01  11:23 PM they both require blood work.. atleast they
                                  can get ya in one stick 

Sharon K   1/16/01  11:23 PM oh no.. not Prozac and Bi-Polar

Terry_VB_m 1/16/01  11:23 PM Yeah, we found out.

Terry_VB_m 1/16/01  11:23 PM Well, actually I was on the Zoloft 

Terry_VB_m 1/16/01  11:25 PM I need to go downstairs to get some water to
                                  take these pills.

Sharon K   1/16/01  11:25 PM ok hon

Terry_VB_m 1/16/01  11:26 PM Ok, I'm back

Sharon K   1/16/01  11:29 PM ok *S*

Sharon K   1/16/01  11:29 PM gulp gulp

Terry_VB_m 1/16/01  11:29 PM right on!

Sharon K   1/16/01  11:30 PM you know if you need to take meds though you
                                  have to.. BUT i so stongrly suggest that you
                                  try exersise and such first

Sharon K   1/16/01  11:30 PM and see if what is bugging you is just life..
                                  if it is.. then deal with it as such.. if it
                                  is a chemical imbalance then deal with it as
                                  that..

Terry_VB_m 1/16/01  11:31 PM Yeah, but I've done so well.  I hate being
                                  dependent on meds.

Terry_VB_m 1/16/01  11:32 PM I think liking my job was what helped keep my
                                  spirit up.  Now that I am not liking that, I
                                  think that's why my spirit is down.

Sharon K   1/16/01  11:32 PM I know.. then get out to the gym.. or wherever
                                  you work out..
                                  
                                  you have alot going on. .. so it may just be
                                  life situations kickin your butt

Terry_VB_m 1/16/01  11:32 PM true

Sharon K   1/16/01  11:32 PM oh, that has alot to do with it most
                                  definatley

Terry_VB_m 1/16/01  11:35 PM I talked with my doctor yesterday about not
                                  taking my meds.  She doesn't have a problem
                                  with my not taking them so long as I can
                                  handle it.  She said, "if it doesn't get
                                  better the next day, or the day after, or the
                                  day after that, you need to go back on the
                                  meds."

Terry_VB_m 1/16/01  11:35 PM I wasn't just taking a low dosage when I was
                                  on them.  I was taking 600 mg of Serzone and
                                  1000mg of Depakote.

Sharon K   1/16/01  11:36 PM I know ppl who took thousands of mg of Dep a
                                  day.. 

Sharon K   1/16/01  11:36 PM 1000 is a bit however.. makes you sluggish

Terry_VB_m 1/16/01  11:37 PM I didn't really have a MD regulating them. 
                                  They pretty much let me do that.

Sharon K   1/16/01  11:38 PM I think that is the way to do it for some
                                  ppl.. esp.. since you are the one who knows
                                  how you feel..

Terry_VB_m 1/16/01  11:38 PM right

Sharon K   1/16/01  11:39 PM left *S*

Terry_VB_m 1/16/01  11:39 PM and I know that the depression is back...I'm
                                  just trying to deal with it without the meds.

Terry_VB_m 1/16/01  11:39 PM All the symptoms are here.

Sharon K   1/16/01  11:39 PM yes, I understand what you are saying. I know
                                  I could go get meds for it right now as well.
                                  it has been almost 2 years though.. and I
                                  don't want them.. I would love to sleep though

Sharon K   1/16/01  11:40 PM I like it better when I get depressed and can
                                  atleast sleep..

Terry_VB_m 1/16/01  11:40 PM I knew when I was getting insomnia that it was
                                  coming back.

Sharon K   1/16/01  11:40 PM yup.. I know I have alot going on though.. so
                                  I keep hanging on..

Terry_VB_m 1/16/01  11:48 PM That's the link for directions to my doorstep

Sharon K   1/16/01  11:49 PM awwwwwwww *S*S ok

Terry_VB_m 1/16/01  11:49 PM It'd probably only take 4 hours...maybe 4 1/2.
                                   They usually say it takes longer than it
                                  actually takes me.  That may be because I
                                  speed, though.

Sharon K   1/16/01  11:50 PM they always say longer than it is.. 

Sharon K   1/16/01  11:50 PM a little over 3 hours really is all it would
                                  take I bet

Terry_VB_m 1/16/01  11:51 PM I know it took us 4 hours to drive to Dover
                                  one time

Sharon K   1/16/01  11:51 PM depending what large towns I would go through

Terry_VB_m 1/16/01  11:51 PM There aren't really any that we went through

Sharon K   1/16/01  11:51 PM oh Dover is only about 30 Miles from here 

Terry_VB_m 1/16/01  11:55 PM Hey, I got my car fixed today.

Sharon K   1/16/01  11:55 PM cool.. what was wrong with it?

Terry_VB_m 1/16/01  11:55 PM It was only $53 vs the $125 I had thought.

Terry_VB_m 1/16/01  11:56 PM The flex pipe broke on the exhaust system.

Sharon K   1/16/01  11:56 PM that is way cool *S*

                                  bad as I thought 

Terry_VB_m 1/16/01  11:58 PM Well, it would've been if I had taken it to
                                  Meineke.

Sharon K   1/16/01  11:58 PM oh yes.. they are expensive..

Terry_VB_m 1/16/01  11:59 PM yup yup.  Midas wanted $230.  I told him
                                  you're fkn crazy.  That's $100 more than
                                  Meineke.  Then I hung up on him.

Sharon K   1/16/01  11:59 PM LOL good.. their name makes them alot of money
                                  that is for sure

Sharon K   1/17/01  11:03 PM she is actually very human..

                                  understand why she laughed, too.

Terry_VB_m 1/17/01  11:04 PM Does she reply to the chatter about the
                                  complaint if it's dismissed?

                                  mood I was in yesterday after I had a long
                                  talk with my old supervisor at work.  I was SO
                                  low, but after our talk, it was like clouds
                                  parting and the sun shining through.

Terry_VB_m 1/20/01  11:23 PM I dont' know how long it'll last.  I told her
                                  she's got a real gift.  I don't know ANYONE
                                  that can do what she did.

Terry_VB_m 1/20/01  11:23 PM I mean when I talk to you I'm very happy

Terry_VB_m 1/20/01  11:24 PM but it goes away when I'm not talking to you
                                  anymore.

Terry_VB_m 1/20/01  11:24 PM but like 20 minutes after I talked to her, it
                                  was amazing how I changed.

Sharon K   1/20/01  11:24 PM wonderful.. you needed someone to help you
                                  outta that space hon

Sharon K   1/20/01  11:25 PM it is someone that you can see 

Terry_VB_m 1/20/01  11:25 PM Yeah.  She works with me

Sharon K   1/20/01  11:25 PM wonderful *S*S*s
                                  
                                  Mwah

Terry_VB_m 1/20/01  11:25 PM I see her a lot.

Sharon K   1/20/01  11:25 PM oh good.. that is great..

Terry_VB_m 1/20/01  11:25 PM I figure I'll meet with her 2 x a week.

Terry_VB_m 1/20/01  11:25 PM She totally understands me

Terry_VB_m 1/20/01  11:25 PM She majored in clinical psych at the
                                  University of VA.

Sharon K   1/20/01  11:26 PM *S* wonderful.. 

Terry_VB_m 1/20/01  11:26 PM I told her she needed to be a psychologist,
                                  not a manager for GEICO.

Sharon K   1/20/01  11:26 PM LOL

Terry_VB_m 1/20/01  11:26 PM I couldn't thank her enough.

Sharon K   1/20/01  11:26 PM that is so great .. really wonderful..

Terry_VB_m 1/20/01  11:26 PM I was definitely in awe how it changed me.  I
                                  went from from feeling no hope to having hope
                                  again.

Sharon K   1/20/01  11:27 PM I am so happy.. I was worried about you hon

Terry_VB_m 1/20/01  11:27 PM We have similar personalities, so she
                                  understands a lot of what I was going through.
                                   Plus, she knows what I'm talking about with
                                  why I'm so frustrated with my work.  She was
                                  our supervisor before we got our manager.

Terry_VB_m 1/20/01  11:28 PM I was worried about me, too

Terry_VB_m 1/20/01  11:28 PM She thinks I should go back on my meds

Sharon K   1/20/01  11:28 PM do you think that?

Terry_VB_m 1/20/01  11:28 PM Like I told her, I don't want to

Sharon K   1/20/01  11:29 PM Hey everyone.. my puter is crashing.. so I
                                  have to totally redo it..
                                  
                                  Please send me a message in the next day or so
                                  if you would like to remain on my list..
                                  
                                  tata for now.. and cover your ears.. it is not
                                  going to be purty.. *S*

Terry_VB_m 1/20/01  11:29 PM You're leaving right now?

Sharon K   1/20/01  11:29 PM yes, that is understandable.. esp.. if you are
                                  feeling better

Sharon K   1/20/01  11:29 PM in a bit *S* just sending out the messages

Sharon K   1/20/01  11:30 PM and if I get booted again.. uh huh.. 

Terry_VB_m 1/20/01  11:30 PM We figured out why I'm so unhappy with my job

Terry_VB_m 1/20/01  11:30 PM My motivation is feeling important...like I'm
                                  making a difference

Sharon K   1/20/01  11:30 PM why is that 

Terry_VB_m 1/20/01  11:30 PM plus, I'm a control freak

Sharon K   1/20/01  11:30 PM oh are you hehe 

Terry_VB_m 1/20/01  11:31 PM but now that my mgr wants to have her hands in
                                  everything and make all the decisions, I can't
                                  handle it.

Terry_VB_m 1/20/01  11:31 PM Erin even recommended that I look for another
                                  job.

Terry_VB_m 1/20/01  11:31 PM She said, "even if you don't leave, sometimes
                                  just knowing you have other options helps."

Sharon K   1/20/01  11:32 PM yes, it really does.. gives you the knowledge
                                  that you are in control still

Terry_VB_m 1/20/01  11:32 PM but she and I both agreed that I'm not happy
                                  and things aren't going to change.  She said I
                                  have to figure out what I'm going to change in
                                  myself to make it work.  If it's not going to
                                  work, then I need to make other options.

Sharon K   1/20/01  11:37 PM everything is freezing up hon.. 

Sharon K   1/20/01  11:37 PM Mwah.. love ya

Terry_VB_m 1/20/01  11:37 PM Love you, too!

Terry_VB_m 1/23/01  11:41 PM I know I'm about over gay.com

Sharon K   1/23/01  11:41 PM it amazes me that such a large company cannot
                                  take care of biz

Sharon K   1/23/01  11:41 PM can I tell you something??

Sharon K   1/23/01  11:41 PM in confidence?

Terry_VB_m 1/23/01  11:41 PM They need to fire those tech support people
                                  and hire some people that knows what they're
                                  doing.

Terry_VB_m 1/23/01  11:41 PM Of course!
                                  

Sharon K   1/23/01  11:41 PM I just sent Pup my resignation

Sharon K   1/23/01  11:42 PM well anyone else for that matter

Sharon K   1/23/01  11:42 PM I am not having fun anymore

Terry_VB_m 1/23/01  11:42 PM Are you still going to be a monitor?

Sharon K   1/23/01  11:42 PM and I am so frustrated that we cannot do
                                  anything. it is like all we can do is field
                                  emails.. 
                                  
                                  oh yes.. I am going to monitor

Sharon K   1/23/01  11:43 PM I may take a Advisory or a trainer and FM
                                  positon or somethign

Terry_VB_m 1/23/01  11:43 PM Dang!  I hate to hear that, Sharon.  Maybe
                                  that will make them sit up and take notice.

Sharon K   1/23/01  11:43 PM yeah.. well I am the most easy going person on
                                  the team.. the one with a clear brain.. 

Sharon K   1/23/01  11:43 PM and the most fun too LOLOLOL

Terry_VB_m 1/23/01  11:43 PM Thank you!

Terry_VB_m 1/23/01  11:44 PM That's what I'm talking about.

Sharon K   1/23/01  11:44 PM *S*

Terry_VB_m 1/23/01  11:44 PM I really hate that

Sharon K   1/23/01  11:44 PM I just am not having any fun

Terry_VB_m 1/23/01  11:44 PM but I understand

Sharon K   1/23/01  11:44 PM and that is what I tell ppl

Sharon K   1/23/01  11:44 PM if it is not good for you don't do it..

Terry_VB_m 1/23/01  11:44 PM Exactly

Sharon K   1/23/01  11:44 PM I cannot focus on it right now..

Sharon K   1/23/01  11:44 PM and even if I did

Sharon K   1/23/01  11:44 PM nothing is going on

Terry_VB_m 1/23/01  11:45 PM Well, it's not like you couldn't go back to
                                  being a TL later on.

Sharon K   1/23/01  11:45 PM now, the pages are down for several weeks

Terry_VB_m 1/23/01  11:45 PM I think that really sucks

Terry_VB_m 1/23/01  11:45 PM I mean it pisses off our members, too

Sharon K   1/23/01  11:45 PM so, once again there is something wrong on
                                  their end

Terry_VB_m 1/23/01  11:45 PM They're always complaining

Sharon K   1/23/01  11:45 PM oh yes.. I find it very frustrating

Sharon K   1/23/01  11:46 PM and we need new monitors.. I have made lists
                                  and checked them so many times.. 

Sharon K   1/23/01  11:46 PM I have more important things to do with my
                                  time

Terry_VB_m 1/23/01  11:46 PM I don't understand what the holdup is.

Sharon K   1/23/01  11:46 PM the pages cannot be made.. 

Terry_VB_m 1/23/01  11:46 PM ah

Sharon K   1/23/01  11:46 PM we cannot imput anything like that

Terry_VB_m 1/23/01  11:46 PM *shaking head*  That's such a shame

Sharon K   1/23/01  11:46 PM for shit sake.. when you have a chathouse..
                                  you make it work.. if the server is messed
                                  up.. you get another one...

Terry_VB_m 1/23/01  11:47 PM Why can't they see that?

Sharon K   1/23/01  11:47 PM I dunno.. maybe it is this simple mind of mine
                                  *S*S* 

Sharon K   1/23/01  11:47 PM one plus one equals two LOLOLOL

Terry_VB_m 1/23/01  11:48 PM You know it!

Terry_VB_m 1/23/01  11:48 PM My neck is so stiff.

Terry_VB_m 1/23/01  11:48 PM I need it massaged.

Sharon K   1/23/01  11:48 PM oh come here hon.. 

Terry_VB_m 1/23/01  11:48 PM That would be so nice.  Thomas (my best
                                  friend) massaged it for maybe a couple minutes
                                  last night when he came over to use my
                                  computer.

Terry_VB_m 1/23/01  11:49 PM but just when I'm starting to enjoy it, anyone
                                  doing it stops

Sharon K   1/23/01  11:49 PM *S*S  
                                  
                                  well call him over again

Sharon K   1/23/01  11:49 PM well shame on them

Terry_VB_m 1/23/01  11:49 PM he's on the phone with his new man

Terry_VB_m 1/23/01  11:49 PM Yeah, I know

Terry_VB_m 1/23/01  11:49 PM cuz I'd do it until they were satisfied
                                  

Terry_VB_m 1/23/01  11:49 PM but then again, I'm a very good friend.

Sharon K   1/23/01  11:50 PM yes you are *S*

Sharon K   1/23/01  11:50 PM I feel so much better now that I told
                                  someone.. 

Terry_VB_m 1/23/01  11:50 PM I'm glad you trust me enough to tell me

Sharon K   1/23/01  11:50 PM I had not even talked with Lora about it yet..

Sharon K   1/23/01  11:50 PM she knows how important it has always been for
                                  me for years..

Terry_VB_m 1/23/01  11:50 PM Wow!  I do feel special

Sharon K   1/23/01  11:51 PM *S*.. she is asleep hahah

Sharon K   1/23/01  11:51 PM lol, no I was going to tell her earlier..

Terry_VB_m 1/23/01  11:51 PM ah...so you just made this decision tonight?

Sharon K   1/23/01  11:51 PM but I decided that  I had already decided..
                                  
                                  I have been thinking about it for a week or so

Sharon K   1/23/01  11:51 PM I keep holding out until the next group of
                                  monitors..

Terry_VB_m 1/23/01  11:52 PM You're a good person

Sharon K   1/23/01  11:52 PM but, I am not responsible for that.. I cannot
                                  wait another 6 months.. I have made myself
                                  available for any orientaions that come along

Sharon K   1/23/01  11:52 PM I think I will remain in the position of
                                  looking out and over the TL and FM.. just as a
                                  silent advisor..

Terry_VB_m 1/23/01  11:52 PM I just think that 7 months is a long time to
                                  take to hire new monitors.

Sharon K   1/23/01  11:53 PM the womens side got 30 monitors since then

Terry_VB_m 1/23/01  11:53 PM Ack!!!

Sharon K   1/23/01  11:54 PM ACK what?

Terry_VB_m 1/23/01  11:54 PM I can't believe they've brought on 30 monitors
                                  and they haven't hired any on the men's side.

Sharon K   1/23/01  11:54 PM it was a TL decision.. 

Sharon K   1/23/01  11:54 PM the men had so many more than we did.. we had
                                  like 4 active monitors..

Terry_VB_m 1/23/01  11:55 PM Good Lord!

Sharon K   1/23/01  11:55 PM the men had over 100 

Sharon K   1/23/01  11:55 PM uh huh.. are side is so much smaller... 

Terry_VB_m 1/23/01  11:56 PM but we've lost a lot since then...and we have
                                  more people

Sharon K   1/23/01  11:56 PM oh yes I know....

Terry_VB_m 1/23/01  11:57 PM I'm so tired.  I need to get my ass to bed.  I
                                  went to bed @ 1:30 last night, but woke up at
                                  5 (wide awake).  I got back to sleep at 6, but
                                  then woke back up at 7...then fell back asleep
                                  by 7:20 (but my alarm goes off at 7:30).  I
                                  was so pissed.

Sharon K   1/23/01  11:58 PM I bet..

Sharon K   1/23/01  11:58 PM ok hon.. you sleep well.. and have wonderful
                                  dreams *S*

Sharon K   1/23/01  11:58 PM I will cya soon.. 
                                  
                                  Mwah

Terry_VB_m 1/23/01  11:58 PM I'm not going to bed yet

Terry_VB_m 1/23/01  11:58 PM I'm talking to my Sharon

Sharon K   1/23/01  11:59 PM LOL... go ahead hon.. I will go chat or
                                  something *S*

Terry_VB_m 1/23/01  11:59 PM NO!  I want to talk to you...I mean I'm in a
                                  much better mood than the last time.  Take
                                  advantage of this while it lasts...cuz I have
                                  no idea how long it will.

Terry_VB_m 1/23/01  11:59 PM I hope I'm out of that pit for good, but I
                                  never know.

Sharon K   1/24/01  12:00 AM yes I know what you mean.. I think being ill
                                  did not do you any good at all.. with a
                                  chemical imbalance.. an illness can set it
                                  right off.. 

Sharon K   1/24/01  12:00 AM and your work was sucking bad for you..

Sharon K   1/24/01  12:00 AM but you are fine now *S*S*

Terry_VB_m 1/24/01  12:01 AM I kjnow

Terry_VB_m 1/24/01  12:01 AM Know, even...cuz I have a plan now

Sharon K   1/24/01  12:01 AM and what is your plan hon?

Terry_VB_m 1/24/01  12:02 AM I'm going to make a proposal to the AVP to
                                  move Licensing from the Planning & Controlling
                                  dept to the HR department...this way we will
                                  have a better manager.

Terry_VB_m 1/24/01  12:02 AM One that will know what she's doing.

Terry_VB_m 1/24/01  12:02 AM and not get her hands into everything we're
                                  doing.

Sharon K   1/24/01  12:03 AM do you think they will go for that?

Terry_VB_m 1/24/01  12:04 AM Well, considering that the program we use
                                  Peoplesoft is an HR program and our Licensing
                                  Division in DC is under HR and our office in
                                  Macon, GA is under HR, I think they might.

Terry_VB_m 1/24/01  12:04 AM Plus, they're going to have the alternative:
                                  loosing me as an employee.

Sharon K   1/24/01  12:05 AM oh my.. well it is always a good idea to give
                                  ppl new outlooks

Terry_VB_m 1/24/01  12:05 AM Yup Yup

Sharon K   1/24/01  12:05 AM gives them something to think about that maybe
                                  for some reason they have not

Terry_VB_m 1/24/01  12:06 AM I already ran it by Erin (my old supervisor). 
                                  She thinks that it's a good idea and that the
                                  AVP might just go for it.

Sharon K   1/24/01  12:06 AM that is great *S*

Terry_VB_m 1/24/01  12:07 AM It's given me hope.  I think that's why I'm in
                                  a better mood

Sharon K   1/24/01  12:07 AM that sure couldn' hurt *S*

Sharon K   1/24/01  12:07 AM Mwah.. just cuz

Terry_VB_m 1/24/01  12:08 AM right on!

Sharon K   1/24/01  12:08 AM do you say right on alot in real??

                                  Diego.  They say that on the West coast a lot.

Sharon K   1/24/01  12:09 AM yes they do.. that is why I was asking.. 

Terry_VB_m 1/24/01  12:09 AM That's where I picked it up

Sharon K   1/24/01  12:09 AM aw

Terry_VB_m 1/24/01  12:36 AM put it out of its misery

Sharon K   1/24/01  12:36 AM LOL.. 

Terry_VB_m 1/25/01  12:11 AM Hey Sharon

Sharon K   1/25/01  12:12 AM Hi Terry hon

Terry_VB_m 1/25/01  12:12 AM How's it going?

Sharon K   1/25/01  12:12 AM it is ok hon.. how are you.. I was wondering
                                  where you were

Terry_VB_m 1/25/01  12:13 AM I just got home at 11:30 from work.  I'm so
                                  sad.  Today was the worst day I've had.  I was
                                  just working away crying my eyes out.  I have
                                  no idea why I stayed.  I'm a complete mess

Sharon K   1/25/01  12:15 AM what is the matter honey??

Sharon K   1/25/01  12:15 AM Oh My.. yesterday was so grand for you darlin

Terry_VB_m 1/25/01  12:15 AM Well, you remember my telling you I had a
                                  plan?

Terry_VB_m 1/25/01  12:15 AM I know.  I hate going from such a good day to
                                  an incredibly bad one.

Sharon K   1/25/01  12:16 AM yes that is so tough hon

Sharon K   1/25/01  12:16 AM *HUG*

Terry_VB_m 1/25/01  12:18 AM Well, the plan I had blew up in my face before
                                  I could even try to get it to work.  I told
                                  one of my coworkers (who had seemed extremely
                                  supportive of the whole idea, and was one of
                                  the people who actually gave me the idea), but
                                  she went and told my manager what I was going
                                  to do.  I got called into my mgr's office
                                  today and confronted about it.  My mgr almost
                                  cried.  I can imagine how upset she
                                  was...especially considering it came from me
                                  (wanting to leave her dept.) 

Sharon K   1/25/01  12:19 AM oh hon.. I have had shit for a day too.. it is
                                  just one of those days sweetie

Terry_VB_m 1/25/01  12:20 AM I mean I haven't been this low since November
                                  of 98

Terry_VB_m 1/25/01  12:20 AM I really need to go back on my meds

Sharon K   1/25/01  12:21 AM can you go in first thing tom???

Terry_VB_m 1/25/01  12:21 AM I have meds in my medicine cabinet.  I hate
                                  taking them.  

Sharon K   1/25/01  12:23 AM well you know now that you should right.. or
                                  find a way to accept rejection hon..

Sharon K   1/25/01  12:23 AM I dont know well enough to know what you need
                                  sweets

Terry_VB_m 1/25/01  12:24 AM It's not really rejection.  I just hate
                                  feeling like I don't have any options.  I'm
                                  looking through the paper tonight for a job.

Terry_VB_m 1/25/01  12:24 AM I know I'm probably not going to be able to
                                  find a job making what I make now.

Terry_VB_m 1/25/01  12:27 AM Enough about me.... let's talk about you

Terry_VB_m 1/25/01  12:27 AM Your letter of resignation sounds like you
                                  don't even want to be a monitor.

Sharon K   1/25/01  12:27 AM it does??
                                  oh my

Sharon K   1/25/01  12:27 AM I did not think of that

Terry_VB_m 1/25/01  12:27 AM yes, it does.

Sharon K   1/25/01  12:27 AM yes, I do believe I want to monitor

Terry_VB_m 1/25/01  12:28 AM Matt_ENC_monitor sent it to me.  He didn't
                                  know I already knew.

Sharon K   1/25/01  12:30 AM sorry I got booted again

Terry_VB_m 1/25/01  12:30 AM I saw that.  Argh!

Sharon K   1/25/01  12:32 AM yes Arg..

Sharon K   1/25/01  12:32 AM heavy sigh

Terry_VB_m 1/25/01  12:32 AM I hate to go to sleep.  I should just pull a
                                  double (wait, I almost did), then not have to
                                  be there when everyone else is.

Sharon K   1/25/01  12:33 AM this is just not a day for us I dont think

Sharon K   1/25/01  12:33 AM you must just face lifes challenges.. 

Terry_VB_m 1/25/01  12:33 AM Well, as I kept telling myself tonight at
                                  work, it can only get better.  

Sharon K   1/25/01  12:33 AM we cannot have everything you know

Sharon K   1/25/01  12:33 AM yes

Sharon K   1/25/01  12:33 AM it always gets bad.. and beter.. life is a
                                  roller coaster

Terry_VB_m 1/25/01  12:34 AM I'm just really glad I made a promise to God
                                  back in Nov of 98 that I would NEVER try to
                                  take my life again.

Sharon K   1/25/01  12:39 AM I am very glad too.. you must not do that
                                  hon.. it is not ok

Terry_VB_m 1/25/01  12:40 AM I know.  I'm just at that level of "low."  I
                                  wish they could give me a seratonin injection.
                                   That's all I need.

Terry_VB_m 1/25/01  12:42 AM and if you knew all that I went through back
                                  in Nov. of 98, you'd know another reason why
                                  I'd never try it.

Terry_VB_m 1/25/01  12:43 AM There's no reason, other than God's
                                  intervention, that I'm here today.  

Sharon K   1/25/01  12:43 AM of coarse there is.. 

Terry_VB_m 1/25/01  12:44 AM Well, I know that everyone has a purpose in
                                  life, and until he serves that purpose, he'll
                                  be here.  I'm just saying that the 5 different
                                  ways that I tried to kill myself were more
                                  than enough to kill a person, yet I lived.

Sharon K   1/25/01  12:45 AM well, then there is most definatly a reason
                                  you are here.. please dont do anything like
                                  tha again.. I just could not take it

Terry_VB_m 1/25/01  12:45 AM I wouldn't.

Sharon K   1/25/01  12:45 AM promise>?? 

Terry_VB_m 1/25/01  12:46 AM *S* Of course

Sharon K   1/25/01  12:48 AM yes it is..

Terry_VB_m 1/25/01  12:48 AM We both need a good long hug

Sharon K   1/25/01  12:48 AM that would make me cry.. and I hate to cry

Terry_VB_m 1/25/01  12:48 AM I hate crying, too.  I get mad at myself when
                                  I do.

Sharon K   1/25/01  12:50 AM oh so do I... 

Terry_VB_m 1/25/01  12:51 AM It's a sign of weakness.  I hate that.

Sharon K   1/25/01  12:51 AM I know honestly that it is not.. but I do feel

Sharon K   1/25/01  10:14 PM put on some clothes?? heheh

Terry_VB_m 1/25/01  10:14 PM I turned the heat up, but it's still so cold. 
                                  I just got the power bill $242 for a month.
                                  YIKES

Sharon K   1/25/01  10:15 PM OMG..

Terry_VB_m 1/25/01  10:15 PM That's what I'm talking about.  I thought last
                                  month was bad.

Terry_VB_m 1/25/01  10:15 PM I'm going to have to work an extra 10 hours of
                                  OT just to pay the power company.  Something
                                  is definitely wrong.

Terry_VB_m 1/25/01  10:15 PM I turn the heat down to 65/67 when I leave for
                                  work and we're never here.

Sharon K   1/25/01  10:16 PM that is alot.. you must have electric heat..

Terry_VB_m 1/25/01  10:16 PM I do

Sharon K   1/25/01  10:17 PM that is the most costly thing

Terry_VB_m 1/25/01  10:17 PM yup yup...but even in my last town house where
                                  we had electric heat/air, our power bill
                                  averaged $80

Terry_VB_m 1/25/01  10:18 PM I can't believe there are 15,522 people logged
                                  into gay.com  We've really taken on a lot of
                                  members/visitors

Sharon K   1/25/01  10:18 PM that is a lot alot.... we keep the heat at 75
                                  *S*S and our bill is only 120 at the most

Terry_VB_m 1/25/01  10:18 PM Lucky you

Sharon K   1/25/01  10:19 PM yes, we were worried about it.. we have a heat
                                  pump though.. 

Terry_VB_m 1/25/01  10:19 PM That's what we have.  That's not electric?

Sharon K   1/25/01  10:21 PM no..

Terry_VB_m 1/25/01  10:21 PM oh

Sharon K   1/25/01  10:22 PM you must have a setting set wrong.. it goees
                                  to electric if you go over 75 I think it is..
                                  or something is wrong with your pump

Terry_VB_m 1/25/01  10:23 PM I don't know.  My cousin who lives on the next
                                  street over (in a townhouse exactly the same)
                                  said her bill was $208 this time.

                                  my heart skip a beat) told me the other night
                                  he doesn't want to meet me because he's afraid
                                  he'll fall in love with me and he's not ready
                                  for that now.

                                   Michael seems to think it's down.  He can't
                                  access his action report.

Sharon K   2/4/01   12:36 AM lol yes.. I would pay the difference LOLOL

Terry_VB_m 2/4/01   12:37 AM I tried Michael's method for removing
                                  parasites. I haven't checked all the main
                                  rooms, but they were in some of them still. I
                                  went through all of those bottom rooms.

Sharon K   2/4/01   12:43 AM did it work pretty well??

Terry_VB_m 2/4/01   12:43 AM It got some of them...but there are still
                                  several that are in the main rooms.

Sharon K   2/4/01   12:44 AM hm.. I think we need to try it out before I
                                  send it to the whole team..

Terry_VB_m 2/4/01   12:52 AM Michael seem to think it works.

Terry_VB_m 2/4/01   12:52 AM They're not in all the rooms, but I've found
                                  them in quite a few of the ones they're
                                  usually in...like DC, Tampa, Miami, etc.

Sharon K   2/4/01   12:55 AM and you are being able to remove most of them
                                  yes??

                                  in.  I guess I should've taken half a pill.  A
                                  full one doesn't seem to do the trick

Sharon K   2/19/01  12:31 AM awww and mixed with the paint fumes

                                  kicked in...and it kinda passed.

                                  Terry

Terry_VB_m 2/27/01  10:21 PM It's not the asterik, it's a bullet

                                  well..

Terry_VB_m 2/27/01  10:22 PM Ah!  it could be b/c I've only seen them from

Terry_VB_m 2/27/01  10:25 PM Hey, how many more monitors are going to be
                                  reinstated?

Sharon K   2/27/01  10:26 PM I don't even know.... they are old emails she
                                  is responding to.. if they were just removed
                                  for not coming to that meeting.. because of
                                  email changes that were missed or something..
                                  she is reinstating them..

Terry_VB_m 2/27/01  10:29 PM Wow!  A lot of monitors must've been cut for
                                  that reason cuz they're popping up everywhere

Terry_VB_m 2/27/01  10:44 PM I downloaded Eudora the other day.  It seems
                                  to be pretty cool.  I'm still hesitant to
                                  switch over, even though it has all my old
                                  messages.  Just because I'm not familiar with
                                  it.

Sharon K   2/27/01  10:45 PM it takes a bit.. I do love it however..

Terry_VB_m 2/27/01  10:45 PM It seems pretty darn neat

Sharon K   2/27/01  10:47 PM it really really is...

Sharon K   2/27/01  10:47 PM I can even work it LOL

Sharon K   2/27/01  10:47 PM I love the filters..

Sharon K   2/27/01  10:47 PM makes my life wonderful

Sharon K   2/27/01  10:50 PM well.. we were suppose to close on the houses
                                  tomorrow.. and found out about 2 hours ago..
                                  that it is not going to happen..

Sharon K   2/27/01  10:50 PM *heavy heavy sigh*

Terry_VB_m 2/27/01  10:51 PM Why?

Sharon K   2/27/01  10:51 PM the person buying it forgot to tell us all she
                                  owes the IRS 98.000

Sharon K   2/27/01  10:51 PM we were moving in less than 12 hours from
                                  now.. 

Sharon K   2/27/01  10:52 PM *sigh* again

Terry_VB_m 2/27/01  10:52 PM $98,000 (thousand) 

Sharon K   2/27/01  10:52 PM they IRS are closing her business tomorrow
                                  morning.

Sharon K   2/27/01  10:52 PM YUP

Terry_VB_m 2/27/01  10:53 PM Just happened to forget, eh?

Sharon K   2/27/01  10:53 PM I am not sure of the details.. she had someone
                                  else tell us.. the attorney did not even know
                                  today.. so must have just happened..

Terry_VB_m 2/27/01  10:54 PM geesh!

Sharon K   2/27/01  10:54 PM yup yup.. always something.. 

Sharon K   2/27/01  10:55 PM it is really sad..

Sharon K   2/27/01  10:55 PM this is the first time I have ever seen Lora
                                  so lost.. she loved the new house

Terry_VB_m 2/27/01  10:57 PM I bet.  And you can't buy the house without
                                  paying the $98,000, right?

Sharon K   2/27/01  10:59 PM the 98,000 is unpaid taxes she owes on her
                                  diner...

Terry_VB_m 2/27/01  10:59 PM oh!

Sharon K   2/27/01  10:59 PM they IRS is saying if she buys this.. that
                                  they will just come and take it from her..

Sharon K   2/27/01  11:00 PM I think she thought she could sink her
                                  personal money in here and hide it before they
                                  caught up with her.. but they caught her a day
                                  too soon..

Sharon K   2/27/01  11:00 PM I think as a personal friend she should have
                                  shared this with us..

Terry_VB_m 2/27/01  11:00 PM yeah, I would think so

Sharon K   2/27/01  11:00 PM yeah.. 

Terry_VB_m 2/27/01  11:04 PM I'm so sorry to hear about that, Sharon.

Sharon K   2/27/01  11:04 PM thanks.. just one more thing..

                                  I think she is great

Sharon K   2/27/01  11:09 PM maybe I have a crush on her *W* 

Terry_VB_m 2/27/01  11:09 PM I think if I was a lesbian I would be, too

Sharon K   2/27/01  11:10 PM yup.. she is all that

Terry_VB_m 2/27/01  11:10 PM And then some

Sharon K   2/27/01  11:10 PM uh huh.. 

Terry_VB_m 2/27/01  11:14 PM I am not liking how she's giving this ruling.

Sharon K   2/27/01  11:15 PM she is worried about the bigger court thing..
                                  but she granted it to them 

Terry_VB_m 2/27/01  11:15 PM Woo Hoo!  3 Cheers for Amy

Terry_VB_m 3/4/01   11:55 PM Hey baby

Sharon K   3/4/01   11:56 PM Hi honey

Terry_VB_m 3/4/01   11:56 PM How are you?

Sharon K   3/4/01   11:56 PM good.. how are you hon?

Terry_VB_m 3/4/01   11:57 PM Doing ok.  I told you about my cousin, right?

Sharon K   3/4/01   11:57 PM I don't think so no?????

Terry_VB_m 3/4/01   11:58 PM Oh!  It must've been Spence.  Well, two
                                  Thursdays ago, she had a stroke.  She's 34 and
                                  just had a baby at the end of December.  A
                                  blood clot formed in her heart after she gave
                                  birth and part of it broke off and went into
                                  her heart and another part went to her brain. 
                                  Last Sunday they had to remove part of her
                                  skull to release the pressure and reduce the
                                  swelling.

Terry_VB_m 3/4/01   11:58 PM After they did that, they saw signs of
                                  improvement.  She was responding to light,
                                  stimulation, etc.

Sharon K   3/4/01   11:59 PM oh my...I know that they can do that kind of
                                  stuff with great results now..

Sharon K   3/4/01   11:59 PM wonderful..

Terry_VB_m 3/4/01   11:59 PM but yesterday she had a backslide: she had a
                                  heart attack and isn't doing well at all.

Sharon K   3/4/01   11:59 PM I hope she continues to improve hon..

Sharon K   3/4/01   11:59 PM oh goodness

Sharon K   3/4/01   11:59 PM poor thing

Terry_VB_m 3/4/01   11:59 PM The doctors told my family that on a scale of
                                  1 to 10 (us being 10 and 1 being gone, she was
                                  between a 2 and 3)

Terry_VB_m 3/5/01   12:00 AM so I've been helping take care of Haily. 
                                  She's so precious.

Sharon K   3/5/01   12:00 AM at the time?? or all together??

Sharon K   3/5/01   12:00 AM I just adore children

Terry_VB_m 3/5/01   12:00 AM Well, my aunt (the one that I live with) has
                                  been staying over there since my cousin had
                                  the stroke.

Terry_VB_m 3/5/01   12:01 AM but I've been watching her on the weekends
                                  while she goes to the hospital

Sharon K   3/5/01   12:01 AM awwwww so sweet.. is she a good baby?

Terry_VB_m 3/5/01   12:02 AM She's incredibly good.  The only times she
                                  really cries is when she's hungry or needs
                                  changed.  Sometimes she cries when she's
                                  sleepy.  But other than that, she's perfectly
                                  content and happy.

Sharon K   3/5/01   12:02 AM wonderful.. *S*

Terry_VB_m 3/5/01   12:02 AM Yeah.  My cousin tried so hard to have a baby.
                                   It's so sad.

Sharon K   3/5/01   12:03 AM it really is just awful.. so is her 2-3 at the
                                  time of her heartattack.. or how she is
                                  overall??

Terry_VB_m 3/5/01   12:03 AM No, her 2-3 is now.

Sharon K   3/5/01   12:03 AM oh my

Sharon K   3/5/01   12:03 AM I will say a prayer for her

Terry_VB_m 3/5/01   12:03 AM Thank you!

Sharon K   3/5/01   12:04 AM *smile*

Terry_VB_m 3/5/01   12:04 AM You wanna hear the poem my mom wrote?  My mom
                                  has such a gift.

Sharon K   3/5/01   12:04 AM oh yes please

Terry_VB_m 3/5/01   12:04 AM My cousin's name is Carolyn Sue Gilder.  The
                                  poem is called "Peace, Be Still"

Sharon K   3/5/01   12:05 AM ok

Terry_VB_m 3/5/01   12:06 AM God Sprinkled stardust from the sky,
                                  the day that you were born,
                                  He sent an angel to protect,
                                  Your precious little form.
                                  
                                  He kept His hand of Love and grace,
                                  Upon you as you grew,
                                  He filled your heart with Love and strength,
                                  And lots of courage, too.
                                  
                                  He gave your wisdom far beyond,
                                  Your very tender years,
                                  So many times He spoke through you,
                                  To comfort others' fears.
                                  (cont)

Terry_VB_m 3/5/01   12:08 AM He gave you joy and happiness,
                                  Which you have always shared,
                                  There is no doubt in anyone,
                                  That you have always cared.
                                  
                                  And now, my precious Carolyn Sue,
                                  Each one your heart has touched,
                                  Is lifting you up to the Lord,
                                  Because we care so much.
                                  
                                  I know my God has heard our cry,
                                  We came in one accord,
                                  To Life you high to Heaven's throne,
                                  For healing from our Lord.
                                  
                                  I trust the mighty hand of God,
                                  By faith I trust His will,
                                  Because I heard the Master say,
                                  "My children, peace, be still."

Terry_VB_m 3/5/01   12:08 AM sorry for the spelling errors.

                                  Christmas.  

Terry_VB_m 3/5/01   12:12 AM This one she wrote right after I moved out

Terry_VB_m 3/5/01   12:24 AM The underage guy left.

Terry_VB_m 3/5/01   12:24 AM Oh!  That's not good.

Terry_VB_m 3/5/01   12:24 AM Isn't Troy Allen the youth manager?

Sharon K   3/5/01   12:24 AM yes, he is just 18 however...

                                  can't prove that he's not 18.  I've heard
                                  rumors but he swears to me he's 18

Sharon K   3/5/01   12:26 AM then there is nothing you can do..

Terry_VB_m 3/5/01   12:26 AM I mean I know the guys who are telling me he's
                                  16 are telling the truth, but it's still their
                                  word against his.  His profile says he's 18. 
                                  Little devil!

Sharon K   3/5/01   12:27 AM uh huh.. that is how it is done..
                                  

Sharon K   3/5/01   12:27 AM Looks like I have to go to the NM room..

                                  pill is just now kicking in.  I hope I can get
                                  up.

Terry_VB_m 3/5/01   12:34 AM My doctor wanted me to take the pill earlier,
                                  but I was stuck babysitting.

Sharon K   3/5/01   12:35 AM ok sweetie.. thanks for your help *S*

Terry_VB_m 3/5/01   12:35 AM Hey, just so you know... I would've voted for
                                  you if they had asked me who should have been
                                  Volunteer of the Year.

Terry_VB_m 3/5/01   12:36 AM You have my undying respect and admiration.

Sharon K   3/5/01   12:36 AM *S*S*S
                                  
                                  well, Jason did deserve it..

Sharon K   3/5/01   12:36 AM Mwah.. ty very much..

Terry_VB_m 3/5/01   12:36 AM You're very welcome.  

Terry_VB_m 3/5/01   12:36 AM *SMOOCH*  good night, sweet princess

Sharon K   3/5/01   12:36 AM good night My handsome..

Terry_VB_m 3/5/01   10:52 PM Hey gorgeous.  I wish you were online so I
                                  could talk to you tonight.  My cousin isn't
                                  doing well at all.  The stroke was apparently
                                  a lot worse than they knew.  Her organs are
                                  failing and I don't know how much longer she's
                                  going to make it.  It's tough trying to be
                                  strong for everyone.  I'll talk to you later. 
                                  Keep me in your prayers.

Sharon K   3/6/01   11:26 PM I will always keep you in my prayer darling..

                                  luv ya heaps

Terry_VB_m 3/6/01   11:51 PM Hey Sharon.  Thanks for keeping me in your
                                  prayers.  I really need it, especially now. 
                                  My cousin passed away this evening around 7:30
                                  p.m.  It hit me a couple hours later when I
                                  was talking with my manager from work.  I
                                  hadn't really cried until then, and I couldn't
                                  stop for several hours later.  I tried
                                  cleaning my house to keep my mind off of it,
                                  but it didn't work.  

Terry_VB_m 3/6/01   11:52 PM My Granny is here at my house now so I've got
                                  to be strong so she doesn't get upset.  I'll
                                  talk to you soon.

Sharon K   3/7/01   3:18 PM  I am so sorry hon... we will keep you in our
                                  prayer..
                                  
                                  much love
                                  Sharon

Terry_VB_m 3/7/01   10:50 PM Thank you!

Sharon K   3/8/01   12:32 AM Hey honey

Terry_VB_m 3/8/01   12:32 AM Hey, I was just looking for you

Sharon K   3/8/01   12:33 AM how are you sweetie??

Sharon K   3/8/01   12:33 AM I got up to get something to drink, and
                                  decided to look for you

Terry_VB_m 3/8/01   12:33 AM Doing ok.  I'm making a CD with songs in
                                  memory of Carolyn to give to my family
                                  members.  

Sharon K   3/8/01   12:33 AM oh hon.. 

Sharon K   3/8/01   12:33 AM *Hug*

Terry_VB_m 3/8/01   12:34 AM They're tear jerkers.

Sharon K   3/8/01   12:34 AM I was thinking about you, and was sending you
                                  some soft thoughts

Sharon K   3/8/01   12:34 AM yes, music is always a tear jerker after
                                  something so emotional

Terry_VB_m 3/8/01   12:34 AM yeah

Sharon K   3/8/01   12:34 AM it is a great expression however

Sharon K   3/8/01   12:35 AM I am so sorry for your family hon

Terry_VB_m 3/8/01   12:35 AM Thank you

Sharon K   3/8/01   12:35 AM no thanks needed

Terry_VB_m 3/8/01   12:35 AM the next 2 days are going to be hard

Sharon K   3/8/01   12:36 AM yes, I imagine so.. is all of your family
                                  around?

Terry_VB_m 3/8/01   12:36 AM yup.  Almost all of my family from WV is here
                                  now.  Some are coming tomorrow.  My brother is
                                  in Kentucky working and couldn't get here. 
                                  He's really upset about that.

Sharon K   3/8/01   12:38 AM I imagine so.. atleast you will have the most
                                  part there..

Terry_VB_m 3/8/01   12:38 AM Yeah.  I'm surprised at how well my family is
                                  holding up.  

Terry_VB_m 3/8/01   12:39 AM Carolyn would have wanted us to.  She was a
                                  very strong individual.  In the Obituary for
                                  the funeral program, my mom wrote, "Carolyn
                                  will always be remembered for her courage,
                                  strength, and her love for everyone."

Sharon K   3/8/01   12:39 AM at this point there is no choice.

Terry_VB_m 3/8/01   12:39 AM I know.

Sharon K   3/8/01   12:39 AM I remember being that way when my father died

Sharon K   3/8/01   12:39 AM I just kept moving.. 

Sharon K   3/8/01   12:39 AM until it was all taken care of..

Terry_VB_m 3/8/01   12:40 AM I've been trying to keep busy.  It really hit
                                  me last night.  I started cleaning my whole
                                  house to keep occupied, but was crying my eyes
                                  out the entire time.

Sharon K   3/8/01   12:41 AM that is how I react too.. I clean and clean..
                                  and cry and cry

Terry_VB_m 3/8/01   12:41 AM I have to be a paul bearer at her funeral.

Terry_VB_m 3/8/01   12:41 AM Her husband wants to be one, too.  I was
                                  shocked when he said that.

Sharon K   3/8/01   12:42 AM I am glad I am a girl when it comes to that..
                                  I don't know if I could do that

Terry_VB_m 3/8/01   12:42 AM I didn't want to, but didn't want to tell him
                                  no, either.

Sharon K   3/8/01   12:43 AM I understand.. if I was a male.. in our family
                                  the males do it.. I would do it.. I am sure
                                  you would only ask someone who was special to
                                  do it..

Terry_VB_m 3/8/01   12:43 AM yeah

Sharon K   3/8/01   12:43 AM yeah.. but extremely difficult..

Terry_VB_m 3/8/01   12:43 AM yup yup

Sharon K   3/8/01   12:44 AM anything I can do for you hon?

Terry_VB_m 3/8/01   12:45 AM nah.  I'll probably need someone to talk to
                                  tomorrow and Friday.

Sharon K   3/8/01   12:45 AM I will be around *S*S*S

Sharon K   3/8/01   12:45 AM I don't work tom.. and not til 5pm on Friday

Terry_VB_m 3/8/01   12:45 AM Thank you!  I knew you were still up b/c I
                                  read a post you wrote on the Monitor Page
                                  board.

Sharon K   3/8/01   12:46 AM *S* always prowling around

Sharon K   3/8/01   12:46 AM I am glad to see your mug there *S*

Sharon K   3/8/01   12:55 AM ok, you can be a mentor *S* shhhhh lol

Sharon K   3/8/01   12:55 AM where did you go??????

Terry_VB_m 3/9/01   12:25 AM Sorry, hon.  My ISP was doing some work behind
                                  the scenes and it shut me off when I was
                                  talking to you and I couldn't log on all day
                                  Thursday.  I just got in a little bit ago from
                                  my cousin Jackie's (Carolyn's sister).  I
                                  didn't do so well tonight.  I lost it when I
                                  was walking my aunt (Carolyn's mom) to the
                                  casket.  Tomorrow is another tough day. 
                                  Hopefully, I'll get to talk to you before you
                                  go to work.  I'm sure I'll need it.  Love you!

Sharon K   3/9/01   10:39 PM Hang in there sweetie.. hopefully I will see
                                  you..
                                  
                                  much love

Sharon K   3/11/01  12:31 AM Hey darlin..
                                  
                                  I have been looking for you.
                                  
                                  I am sure you are much too busy.
                                  
                                  Thinking of you..
                                  
                                  Much Love

Terry_VB_m 3/11/01  6:42 AM  Dang!  I must be missing you by minutes.  I
                                  think I went to bed right before you sent the
                                  last message.  I was drunk so I fell asleep
                                  pretty early.  Now I'm awake at 6:42 a.m.
                                  drinking water so I don't get a terrible
                                  hangover.  Ack!  

Terry_VB_m 3/11/01  11:10 PM Hey gorgeous

Sharon K   3/11/01  11:11 PM Hey.. didn't see you sneak in honey

Terry_VB_m 3/11/01  11:12 PM How's everything going?
                                  

Sharon K   3/11/01  11:13 PM ok hon.. how are you?? rough time hey?

Terry_VB_m 3/11/01  11:14 PM Yeah.  I caught a bad cold or sinus infection
                                  one.  My throat is SO sore.  It hurts to
                                  swallow. From what I can tell my right tonsil
                                  is swollen.  I'm VERY congested.

Terry_VB_m 3/11/01  11:15 PM but other than that, I'm hanging in there

Sharon K   3/11/01  11:15 PM oh my.. now you are sick again.. gosh..

                                  was at the doctors.  

Terry_VB_m 3/11/01  11:16 PM and I have to go back to work tomorrow.  It

                                  (although I slept all day).  I hated it b/c it
                                  was such a nice day.

Terry_VB_m 3/11/01  11:22 PM I'm sure.  She said I'd owe her for bringing a
                                  hottie back.  I told her if he's really hot,
                                  we could work something out.

Sharon K   3/11/01  11:23 PM too cute..

                                  liked the picture you have on your profile

                                  the stairs.

Terry_VB_m 3/12/01  11:12 PM I could've done without seeing Puppet's

                                  other than you, me, and Matt_ENC.

Sharon K   3/12/01  11:24 PM I know.. I think Shell is kinda cute.

                                  they don't know me *S*

Terry_VB_m 3/12/01  11:25 PM lol

Terry_VB_m 3/12/01  11:26 PM I would have never pictured Puppet like her
                                  picture.

Terry_VB_m 3/12/01  11:26 PM for someone who is a year younger than you,
                                  Crystal looks like 10 years older.

Sharon K   3/12/01  11:26 PM yes, she really does look older.. and ppl put

Sharon K   3/12/01  11:28 PM I love you gentle look on your face btw

Sharon K   3/12/01  11:28 PM oh no.. I don't have a picture.. thought you

Terry_VB_m 3/12/01  11:28 PM nah, never really talked to Tonie

Sharon K   3/12/01  11:29 PM aw ok.. 

Sharon K   3/12/01  11:29 PM I think we are getting 80 male monitors next
                                  w/e

Sharon K   3/12/01  11:30 PM Muhahahahah

Terry_VB_m 3/12/01  11:30 PM *WARNING*  Power trips are inevitable

Sharon K   3/12/01  11:30 PM whatcha mean???

Terry_VB_m 3/12/01  11:30 PM new monitors always have power trips

Sharon K   3/12/01  11:30 PM oh yes.. I know.. LOL

Terry_VB_m 3/12/01  11:30 PM They're all overly rambunctious

Sharon K   3/12/01  11:30 PM we loose several in the first few weeks..

Sharon K   3/12/01  11:31 PM Yup.. I wish we could take their ban buttons
                                  for a month..

Sharon K   3/12/01  11:31 PM wow, that was a great idea I just had..

Sharon K   3/12/01  11:31 PM *making a note*

Terry_VB_m 3/12/01  11:31 PM Good idea

Terry_VB_m 3/12/01  11:31 PM Hey, you know when I ban a parasite, it
                                  doesn't ban them from all the floors.  Isn't
                                  it supposed to now?

Sharon K   3/12/01  11:32 PM yes, it is suppose to.. I think they were
                                  working on that..

Terry_VB_m 3/12/01  11:32 PM Well, it's not.

Sharon K   3/12/01  11:32 PM they really want us to kick now... grrrrrrrr

Sharon K   3/12/01  11:32 PM for parasites.. it is so much easier to ban it
                                  and have it leave all the rooms..

Terry_VB_m 3/12/01  11:33 PM If it would do that

Sharon K   3/12/01  11:33 PM yes, if it only worked well.. *sigh*

Terry_VB_m 3/12/01  11:40 PM well, my sheets are dry and on the bed.  It's
                                  time for me to crawl in there.  My body needs
                                  lots of rest to get rid of this daggone cold.

Sharon K   3/12/01  11:41 PM ok sweetie.. I am outta here too then
                                  cya tomorrow..

Sharon K   3/15/01  10:01 PM good hon... but how are you doing? 

Terry_VB_m 3/15/01  10:01 PM I'm good

Sharon K   3/15/01  10:02 PM not too convincing... 

Terry_VB_m 3/15/01  10:03 PM *S*  Really, I'm doing ok.  I'm glad to be
                                  feeling better.

Sharon K   3/15/01  10:03 PM *S ok, now that I can believe 

Terry_VB_m 3/15/01  10:03 PM I'm getting cable modem tomorrow, digital
                                  cable on Saturday...and I'm going to a
                                  computer show so hopefully I'll be able to buy
                                  a new Motherboard and processor to upgrade.

Sharon K   3/15/01  10:06 PM I think my computer has a virus...

Sharon K   3/15/01  10:06 PM something is really wrong with it 

Sharon K   3/15/01  10:07 PM now, you cannot even shut down without
                                  unplugging it.. I mean hitting the power off
                                  on the breaker bar

Sharon K   3/15/01  10:07 PM it is getting really bad..

Terry_VB_m 3/15/01  10:07 PM Ugh!  Mine keeps acting crazy, too.  I'm
                                  hoping when I upgrade it will stop.

Sharon K   3/15/01  10:09 PM I don't have a good virus scan to find out.. I
                                  guess when I get my taxes I will have to take
                                  it in.. I always have so many other things I
                                  need to spend my money on... 

Terry_VB_m 3/15/01  10:10 PM Download AVG

Sharon K   3/15/01  10:10 PM what is that??

Sharon K   3/15/01  10:10 PM where is that?

Terry_VB_m 3/15/01  10:11 PM let me find the address for it.  It's a good
                                  anti-virus program.  It even scans incoming
                                  emails.

Terry_VB_m 3/15/01  10:26 PM Ok.  I have to ask this because I've been
                                  dying to know for the last few weeks.  Why was
                                  I passed over for the FM position?  Don't get
                                  me wrong, I don't believe I'd like having to
                                  put in that much time on the NE floor, and I
                                  think Jason (Matt_ENC) is an excellent
                                  monitor, but I'm just curious why I wasn't
                                  even asked.  

Sharon K   3/15/01  10:26 PM You did not show interest in it...

Sharon K   3/15/01  10:27 PM He Wrote an email asking for the position..
                                  and it was open for talk then..

Sharon K   3/15/01  10:27 PM the way things go around here is that we
                                  always look at Volunteers for things..

Terry_VB_m 3/15/01  10:27 PM He did!?!?

Sharon K   3/15/01  10:27 PM Yup!!

Sharon K   3/15/01  10:27 PM He did

Sharon K   3/15/01  10:28 PM I think he will be good..

Terry_VB_m 3/15/01  10:28 PM I think he will be, too.

Terry_VB_m 3/15/01  10:29 PM I can't believe he would have flat-out told me
                                  the week b4 he got it he "wouldn't have the
                                  position" and then send an email expressing
                                  interest.

Sharon K   3/15/01  10:29 PM yeah... we may have another one coming up
                                  *S*.. shhhhhhhhh

Sharon K   3/15/01  10:29 PM he did not know... 

Sharon K   3/15/01  10:29 PM we gave a generic answer.. as we usually do
                                  before we gather all our info

Terry_VB_m 3/15/01  10:29 PM *scratches head*  What do you mean he did not
                                  know?

Sharon K   3/15/01  10:30 PM he did not know we were even concidering
                                  it....

Sharon K   3/15/01  10:30 PM we just thanked him for his good work..

Sharon K   3/15/01  10:30 PM OH
                                  

Sharon K   3/15/01  10:30 PM I see what you are saying..

Sharon K   3/15/01  10:30 PM sorry, misunderstood

Sharon K   3/15/01  10:30 PM hmmmmmm 

Sharon K   3/15/01  10:30 PM I think someone asked him.. as in another FM..

Terry_VB_m 3/15/01  10:31 PM He said Jason asked him.

Sharon K   3/15/01  10:32 PM I did not know who.. or could not remember...

Sharon K   3/15/01  10:32 PM I did not actually think you would like it... 

Terry_VB_m 3/15/01  10:33 PM It doesn't matter.  I just was curious b/c he
                                  told me he had no interest in the position but
                                  that they (Jason) approached him and he told
                                  Jason that he'd try it and see.

Terry_VB_m 3/15/01  10:33 PM It never ceases to amaze me how two-faced
                                  people are.

Sharon K   3/15/01  10:33 PM that could be true.. could be what brought on
                                  the email *S*

Sharon K   3/15/01  10:34 PM it could be true... I did not pay total
                                  attention to how it got there..

Terry_VB_m 3/15/01  10:34 PM I just figured I was passed over b/c I didn't
                                  read the boards as often.

Sharon K   3/15/01  10:34 PM Oh No.. not at all *S*

Terry_VB_m 3/15/01  10:35 PM Well, the reason I thought that was Jason was
                                  in my Help room one night asking all kinds of
                                  probing questions like, "How often did I go to
                                  the message boards?"  "What would it take to
                                  get me to go there more often?"

Sharon K   3/15/01  10:36 PM I think the boards are his mission these
                                  days.. he asks everyone that 

Sharon K   3/15/01  10:36 PM LOL

Terry_VB_m 3/15/01  10:37 PM Well, after he asked me that I have been
                                  reading them every day.  I just didn't read
                                  them because it seemed to be a lot of nothing
                                  in there.

Terry_VB_m 3/15/01  10:38 PM and I always get so engrossed in a
                                  controversial topic, like the barebacking
                                  subject...and I'll write a long, thought-out,
                                  message that takes me an hour to approve (to
                                  make sure it's perfect) before I post it.

Sharon K   3/15/01  10:39 PM The boards are tough for me too.. I have to
                                  remember my title as well, when I would like
                                  to just jump in.. they frustrate me a bit..

Terry_VB_m 3/15/01  10:41 PM Well, I'm glad I finally asked you that. 
                                  Whew!

Sharon K   3/15/01  10:42 PM *S* me too if it was on your mind...
                                  
                                  I really did not think you would like it
                                  however.... I think we talked about it
                                  before..

Terry_VB_m 3/15/01  10:43 PM I wouldn't have accepted the position for the
                                  NE floor...simply because I'm not as familiar
                                  with it as I am the SE floor.  I'd have felt
                                  like a transplant.  Plus, I understand TDK can
                                  be a little diff to get along with (from his
                                  comments on the boards, I can tell he has a
                                  very strong personality) so that probably
                                  wouldn't have been the best.

Sharon K   3/15/01  10:44 PM LOLOLOLOL
                                  you do have that right about him.. he does not
                                  mix his words.. he has a good heart however..

Sharon K   3/15/01  10:44 PM I knew you would not want that position.. and
                                  if you did Mister you sure knew someone you
                                  could have asked *S* 

Terry_VB_m 3/15/01  10:45 PM Most definitely, if I had wanted the position,
                                  I would have asked.

Sharon K   3/15/01  10:46 PM I think so too.. *S*
                                  
                                  If I thought that it was good for you .. I too
                                  would have asked you *S*

Terry_VB_m 3/15/01  10:47 PM I'm just a little disappointed in my bud, Jas
                                  (Matt_ENC).

Sharon K   3/15/01  10:48 PM oh don't be.. you know.. that things get a tad
                                  weird on here.... someones words sometimes
                                  cannot really express what they mean..

Sharon K   3/15/01  10:48 PM know what I mean??

Sharon K   3/15/01  10:49 PM He seems really genuine..

Terry_VB_m 3/15/01  10:49 PM I know him...he used to come spend the
                                  weekends @ my house.

Sharon K   3/15/01  10:51 PM really??
                                  
                                  Is he a nice guy like he seems.??

Terry_VB_m 3/15/01  10:51 PM He's really cool to hang with.

Sharon K   3/15/01  10:51 PM ok, hmmmmmm

Sharon K   3/15/01  10:51 PM nice try to avoid but ok hehe

Terry_VB_m 3/15/01  10:52 PM See...I'm a politician at heart... You ask a
                                  question, i give you an answer, which seems
                                  like the answer, unless you really think about
                                  what question you asked.

Sharon K   3/15/01  10:53 PM yup..

Sharon K   3/15/01  10:53 PM you don't fool me you know??

Terry_VB_m 3/15/01  10:53 PM I know, hon...that's why I love you.

Sharon K   3/15/01  10:53 PM I let you think so sometimes..

Sharon K   3/15/01  10:53 PM *S*

Sharon K   3/15/01  10:54 PM and yes, you could be a politician

Terry_VB_m 3/15/01  10:54 PM I know I don't fool you.  You read right
                                  through me.  I tell my friend Thomas, when I
                                  talk to him these days, that you are
                                  incredible...that on a bad day I can simply
                                  say Hello to you and you're like, "what's
                                  wrong?"

Sharon K   3/15/01  10:54 PM you bob and weave well

Sharon K   3/15/01  10:54 PM yup.. it is amazing.. I can look at exactly
                                  the same words from you.. and feel what form
                                  they are coming in..

Sharon K   3/15/01  10:55 PM I just have to decide if I let you be or not..
                                  *S*

Terry_VB_m 3/15/01  11:14 PM I'm an overachiever...a perfectionist

Sharon K   3/15/01  11:14 PM YES I KNOW

Sharon K   3/15/01  11:14 PM LOLOL

Sharon K   3/15/01  11:14 PM I am an achiever.. and usually very content
                                  and happy 

Sharon K   3/15/01  11:14 PM ROTFLMAO.. and funny too *W*

Terry_VB_m 3/15/01  11:14 PM I'm learing to cope with the perfectionist
                                  thing.

Terry_VB_m 3/15/01  11:14 PM It's not easy

Sharon K   3/15/01  11:15 PM good.. my ex was like that as well.. it was a
                                  huge issue..

Sharon K   3/15/01  11:15 PM I know what you are talking about

Sharon K   3/15/01  11:15 PM I think it would be extremley tough to be like
                                  that..

Terry_VB_m 3/15/01  11:15 PM It's hard...and it's hard finding someone

Sharon K   3/15/01  11:15 PM Her therapist told me to leave things laying
                                  around..

Sharon K   3/15/01  11:15 PM so that she could adjust

Sharon K   3/15/01  11:16 PM it is like OCD

Terry_VB_m 3/15/01  11:16 PM I eventually do, too.  I couldn't have made it
                                  growing up if I hadn't have.

Terry_VB_m 3/15/01  11:16 PM I'm not to the OCD point.

Sharon K   3/15/01  11:16 PM ok

Sharon K   3/15/01  11:16 PM LOL 

Sharon K   3/15/01  11:16 PM that was simple..

Sharon K   3/15/01  11:16 PM ok sweetie..
                                  off to bed for you and me

Sharon K   3/15/01  11:17 PM I will see you tomorrow..

Terry_VB_m 3/18/01  6:50 PM  Michael

Sharon K   3/18/01  6:50 PM  LOL ok.. 

Sharon K   3/18/01  6:51 PM  I will go find him now... I heard he was
                                  looking for a TL.. guess I am the sacrificed
                                  one

Terry_VB_m 3/18/01  6:51 PM  He said that he needed to speak to
                                  you...something about he's pissed.
                                  

Terry_VB_m 3/18/01  6:51 PM  You, TDK & Jason

Terry_VB_m 3/18/01  6:51 PM  he said he needed to speak to you all

Terry_VB_m 3/18/01  6:51 PM  and his floor manager

Sharon K   3/18/01  6:51 PM  ok.. yes I know he is upset..

Terry_VB_m 3/18/01  6:51 PM  *** DRAMA ALERT ***

Sharon K   3/18/01  6:51 PM  I will go looking for him now.. 

Terry_VB_m 3/18/01  6:52 PM  Then come give me the scoop.  I've missed you.

Sharon K   3/18/01  6:52 PM  ROTFLMAO.. ppl don't like Mandatory
                                  Vacations..

Sharon K   3/18/01  6:52 PM  ok I will.. 

Terry_VB_m 3/18/01  6:52 PM  a what?  Sounds like that's a nice way of
                                  saying, get lost.

Sharon K   3/18/01  6:53 PM  no no.. only a week off.. we have been
                                  starting to do it more often now, as ppl are
                                  burning out and getting nasty attitudes..

Sharon K   3/18/01  6:53 PM  it is making someone who spends 24/7 take a
                                  day off..

Terry_VB_m 3/18/01  6:54 PM  Ah!  Yeah, that makes sense.  Yesterday I put
                                  in so much time that it gave me a tension
                                  headache.  When I get like that, I WILL NOT
                                  stay in the Help room.  I don't like to
                                  monitor if I can't be bubbly and chat friendly
                                  with the members & visitors.

Sharon K   3/18/01  6:54 PM  EXACTLY... ok Jason Micheal and Ryan are on..
                                  I have to go meet with them.. I will catch you
                                  when I get back
                                  
                                  smooch

Sharon K   3/18/01  6:56 PM  I am going to log off here.. but I will be
                                  back after the meeting..

Terry_VB_m 3/18/01  6:59 PM  Ok babe.  Whew!  

Sharon K   3/18/01  6:59 PM  *S*

                                  acting like that

Terry_VB_m 3/18/01  8:05 PM  I know.  If anything, that's what gets on my
                                  nerves when I'm on duty

Sharon K   3/19/01  10:07 PM so you have your puter all set up hey?

Terry_VB_m 3/19/01  10:07 PM The server on gay.com is so slow tonight

Terry_VB_m 3/19/01  10:07 PM even for my new cable modem

Sharon K   3/19/01  10:07 PM my puter is messed up too...

Terry_VB_m 3/19/01  10:07 PM it set up yet.

Sharon K   3/19/01  10:07 PM that is wonderful *S*

Terry_VB_m 3/19/01  10:08 PM Some guy was in the room with us right b4 you
                                  disappeared.  He thinks I was ignoring him,
                                  but I didn't even see his conversation until
                                  after he was already gone.

Sharon K   3/19/01  10:08 PM this one is only about a year old.. but when I
                                  get my taxes I may get a new one and fix this
                                  one up for the kids

Terry_VB_m 3/19/01  10:09 PM If you know someone to install it, it's
                                  cheaper to buy from a computer show like I
                                  did...or off of www.pricewatch.com

Sharon K   3/19/01  10:09 PM yeah.. the neighbor lady is a computer wiz ..
                                  I just have to find extra money for it is all

Sharon K   3/19/01  10:09 PM I feel guilty when I could buy the kids
                                  something extra and want something for myself

Terry_VB_m 3/19/01  10:09 PM Well, you can get a bang-up motherboard and
                                  good processor for $200

Sharon K   3/19/01  10:10 PM so, I usually just don't buy it

Terry_VB_m 3/19/01  10:10 PM Yeah, I have such a hard time justifying
                                  buying myself something when I could just pay
                                  the bills or something.

Sharon K   3/19/01  10:10 PM mine may be able to be fixed really easily..
                                  as I think I did it when I deleted a bunch of
                                  stuf.. lol

Sharon K   3/19/01  10:11 PM I am playing the slot things on pogo.. the

                                  or if I just messed it up

Sharon K   3/19/01  11:05 PM yeah.. I messed it up good about a month ago

Sharon K   3/19/01  11:05 PM smacking head on desk

Terry_VB_m 3/19/01  11:05 PM That's why I'm not installing my computer
                                  stuff

Sharon K   3/19/01  11:05 PM I know better than to go into program files
                                  and delete a bunch of stuff.. *sigh*

Terry_VB_m 3/19/01  11:05 PM I tried to install memory a long time ago and
                                  fkd my computer up for a week

Terry_VB_m 3/19/01  11:07 PM um...go to the microsoft website and download
                                  windows update

Terry_VB_m 3/19/01  11:07 PM maybe you need an upgrade 

Terry_VB_m 3/19/01  11:07 PM It fixed mine once.

Terry_VB_m 3/19/01  11:07 PM It's worth a shot

Terry_VB_m 3/19/01  11:07 PM I just wish you had DSL.  It takes so little
                                  time.

Terry_VB_m 3/19/01  11:08 PM but it's worth the 10 minutes or whatever

Sharon K   3/19/01  11:08 PM I wish I did too.. they don't have it in my
                                  area yet...what is the website I am looking
                                  for?

Terry_VB_m 3/19/01  11:08 PM www.microsoft.com/downloads  see if that
                                  works.  If not, take the downloads off

Sharon K   3/19/01  11:09 PM got it.. the end is ms.htm

                                  should

Terry_VB_m 3/20/01  12:35 AM Oh, and you can set up AVG to scan your
                                  computer every day at a certain time.  I have
                                  mine run late at night so it doesn't bother my
                                  work in the evenings.

Sharon K   3/20/01  12:35 AM we can always learn something as things are
                                  always changing

                                  to put it in a vault..

Terry_VB_m 3/20/01  12:40 AM yes, you want to do that

Terry_VB_m 3/20/01  12:40 AM It'll keep it from infecting any other
                                  programs

                                  in www.ask.com and the first thing it says is
                                  "where can I find basic information about
                                  marijuana?"

Terry_VB_m 3/24/01  12:04 AM It's just as though I smoked a big bowl

Terry_VB_m 3/24/01  12:05 AM It's for depression

Terry_VB_m 3/24/01  12:05 AM I think it's a combination of the Remeron
                                  (sedating antidepressant) and Effexor @ 75 mg.

Terry_VB_m 3/24/01  12:27 AM Look @ what it says when I looked the drug up
                                  online.  Using these medicines with
                                  venlafaxine may increase the chance of
                                  developing a rare, but very serious, unwanted
                                  effect known as
the serotonin syndrome;  To Be
                                  Continued.

Terry_VB_m 3/24/01  12:27 AM symptoms of this syndrome include confusion,
                                  diarrhea, fever, poor coordination,
                                  restlessness, shivering, sweating, talking or
                                  acting with excitement you cannot control,
                                  trembling or shaking, or twitching; if you
                                  experience these symptoms contact your doctor
                                  as soon as possible

Terry_VB_m 3/26/01  7:26 PM  Hey gorgeous, I hope you're not in bed yet. 
                                  If you are, then I hope you're having
                                  wonderful dreams of me.  I'll talk to you when
                                  you get back from up north.  Yes, I'm having
                                  those symptoms.  They weren't as pronounced
                                  today, but I could still feel getting high,
                                  but it only starts around noon.  Today was a
                                  little earlier around 11.   I'm feeling no
                                  pain.  Mouahah

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  10:09 PM Hey girlfriend

Sharon K   3/27/01  10:10 PM hey honey *S* how are you feeling..

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  10:10 PM Oh!  Our show is on.  Her boyfriend that she
                                  was in the tub with last weekend is SO hot.

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  10:10 PM I'm good

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  10:10 PM High, but good

Sharon K   3/27/01  10:10 PM OH My.. I better turn it on..

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  10:13 PM It's never the slow drama stuff like the tub
                                  scene at the beginning of the show.  It
                                  doesn't flow that way on this kind of show.

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  10:13 PM LOL @ The Canadian bimbo comment

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  10:13 PM Spence would like that

Sharon K   3/27/01  10:14 PM LOLOL uh huh.. I never see her anymore.. where
                                  is she?

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  10:15 PM *shrugs*  I dunno.  She was on when I signed
                                  on, then signed off.

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  10:15 PM Oh, my fingers are so cold.

Sharon K   3/27/01  10:15 PM why? 

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  10:15 PM It's cold out?

Sharon K   3/27/01  10:15 PM oh lolol.. 

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  10:17 PM I think it's cuz I'm high I'm not feeling my
                                  fingers.  I go from hot to cold to hot again. 
                                  It's like I'm going through the change.

Sharon K   3/27/01  10:25 PM did you speak to your doctor today about all
                                  of this?? it should not be like this honey

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  10:25 PM Um...she's out of town until next week.  I
                                  have an appointment on the 6th.  I'm getting
                                  used to it...the being high feeling.  Which
                                  sucks now if I ever wanted to smoke a joint. 
                                  Although, I'm high all the time now anyway. 
                                  It's so funny.  It hits me every day @ noon

Sharon K   3/27/01  10:26 PM I don't like that.. I think you are having a
                                  reaction to it..

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  10:26 PM I like it, though.  I'm so relaxed...and
                                  everything is just funny.

Sharon K   3/27/01  10:27 PM LOLOL well, I don't think that is its
                                  purpose..

Sharon K   3/27/01  10:27 PM Hey... I had lunch with TDK today..

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  10:29 PM That's cool.  Is he cute?

Sharon K   3/27/01  10:29 PM LOL yes he is.. and he brought me a present..
                                  wanna know what it is??

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  10:30 PM Yes!  Yes!

Sharon K   3/27/01  10:31 PM NO  A real Tiarra *S*S*S*S*S*S*S*

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  10:31 PM OMG!  No, he didn't!?!?

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  10:31 PM That's too neat

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  10:31 PM *pouts*  And is what I was going to give you
                                  when we met for the first time.

Sharon K   3/27/01  10:32 PM really??? hehe 
                                  
                                  sowy... but I have a real tiarra.. and I am
                                  really wearing it ROTFLMAO

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  10:33 PM I would pay ANYTHING to see you now

Sharon K   3/27/01  10:35 PM *smile**

Sharon K   3/27/01  10:35 PM I am in my flannel jammies with a tiarra on

Sharon K   3/27/01  10:35 PM ROTFLMAO

                                  have to hook it up..

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  10:36 PM Yes!

Sharon K   3/27/01  10:36 PM I had Mike take a pic of me wearing it.. so I
                                  will get it developed this week *S*

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  10:37 PM So how expensive of a tiarra are we talking?

Sharon K   3/27/01  10:37 PM oh heck I don't know.. it will last me a long
                                  time... that is for sure... it is actually
                                  pretty nice.. a solid one..

Sharon K   3/27/01  10:38 PM ok sweetie

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  10:39 PM Gonna reboot

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  11:14 PM hey, ol' Matt_ENC is really lovin the FM thing

Sharon K   3/27/01  11:15 PM whatcha mean??

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  11:16 PM I just asked him how it's going, and he just
                                  seems really excited about it all.  I told him
                                  it's funny to see how he's taken possession of
                                  the NE floor.

Sharon K   3/27/01  11:16 PM LOL.. he is really loving it.. *S*

Sharon K   3/27/01  11:18 PM oh ya.. I want to ask you something

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  11:19 PM ok

Sharon K   3/27/01  11:20 PM were you in the NM room with your badge and
                                  not logged in last week>

Sharon K   3/27/01  11:20 PM officially unofficial LOL

Sharon K   3/27/01  11:20 PM maybe this w/e.. I cannot remember right off
                                  hand

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  11:20 PM New Mexico?

Sharon K   3/27/01  11:20 PM uh huh

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  11:20 PM I'm not sure I've ever been in that room

Sharon K   3/27/01  11:21 PM PUP said you did not have that go round with
                                  Metro either????

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  11:21 PM I was on the Pacific floor a few weeks ago

Sharon K   3/27/01  11:21 PM no, this was the other night

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  11:21 PM Nah, I haven't even been online with MG in a
                                  LONG time.

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  11:21 PM I figured someone was impersonating me when MG
                                  said that on the boards

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  11:22 PM about me asking him about his uniform in the
                                  Help room

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  11:22 PM I questioned him in there "When did I ask
                                  this?"

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  11:22 PM Then PUP asked me the other night if I
                                  challenged a decision of his to remove someone
                                  from the Central floor.

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  11:23 PM I told him I have NEVER challenged MG's
                                  decision.  I'm never on when he is, or on the
                                  same floor.

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  11:23 PM not that I wouldn't, if I thought he did
                                  something wrong.

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  11:23 PM *S*

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  11:23 PM I am oppionated that way

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  11:23 PM but not confrontational

Sharon K   3/27/01  11:24 PM yeah.. we all think it was not you

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  11:24 PM I wonder who is impersonating me.

Sharon K   3/27/01  11:24 PM but your name has stuck again this week end
                                  LOLOL

Sharon K   3/27/01  11:24 PM dunno..

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  11:24 PM Flattering, but frustrating

Sharon K   3/27/01  11:24 PM LOL

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  11:25 PM I like my name being mentioned among the
                                  important people, but not when it's bad.

Sharon K   3/27/01  11:25 PM the thing with MG was about you coming in the
                                  help room and asking him why he banned someone
                                  the night before

Sharon K   3/27/01  11:25 PM yeah.. ppl are getting a little worried..

Sharon K   3/27/01  11:25 PM I have tried to stay out of it for the most
                                  part..

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  11:26 PM Really!?!?

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  11:26 PM Drama over me?

Sharon K   3/27/01  11:27 PM oh ya.. it is one of the major issues right
                                  now

Sharon K   3/27/01  11:27 PM Lemme grab my mail real fast and tell you were
                                  they saw you..

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  11:29 PM Wow

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  11:29 PM And to think, I've spent less time on gay.com
                                  in the last month than I have in ages

Sharon K   3/27/01  11:29 PM there are many in the last week.. 

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  11:29 PM and this is when shit happens with my name

Sharon K   3/27/01  11:29 PM LOLOL

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  11:29 PM There are many what?

Sharon K   3/27/01  11:30 PM I think you might want to send a letter to the
                                  FM addy telling them you think someone is
                                  impersonating you..

Sharon K   3/27/01  11:30 PM they are trying to figure out if something is
                                  really wrong with you lately..

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  11:30 PM I told PUP that the other night.

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  11:30 PM Really!?!?

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  11:30 PM OMG

Sharon K   3/27/01  11:30 PM Be careful you don't get a mandatory vacation
                                  for working so hard

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  11:30 PM No wonder Matt_ENC has been acting funny

Sharon K   3/27/01  11:30 PM yes, really

Sharon K   3/27/01  11:31 PM uh huh.. they think something may be wrong
                                  with you

Sharon K   3/27/01  11:31 PM ROTFLMAO

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  11:31 PM OMG

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  11:31 PM I'm in awe

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  11:31 PM I haven't been on there b/c it's hard
                                  monitoring when I'm high

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  11:31 PM I can't multi-task like normal

Sharon K   3/27/01  11:31 PM yup.. 

Sharon K   3/27/01  11:32 PM I keep telling them I HAVE to see an IP.. and
                                  they did not get one yet

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  11:32 PM Thank you for standing up for me

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  11:32 PM This is unreal

Sharon K   3/27/01  11:32 PM I have the cut and paste of the talk with MG..

Sharon K   3/27/01  11:33 PM noone really thinks it is you.. we were trying
                                  to leave it to the chain of command.. but PUP
                                  has had some major puter issues this week.

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  11:33 PM he talked to me about it the other week and
                                  told me that he didnt' think it was me,
                                  either...That it sounded fishy

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  11:34 PM not the other week, the other night

Sharon K   3/27/01  11:35 PM Right

Sharon K   3/27/01  11:35 PM yeah.. he just emailed us on it.. he says he
                                  does not think it was you.. and then the next
                                  day.. a FM saw your name in the NM room, with
                                  your badge on and not logged it

Sharon K   3/27/01  11:35 PM LOLOL

Sharon K   3/27/01  11:37 PM I wish you would behave ROTFLMAO

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  11:37 PM I know

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  11:38 PM Well, tell them to call GEICO.  That's where I
                                  am

Sharon K   3/27/01  11:38 PM who should call GEICO?

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  11:38 PM whoever is saying they saw me

Sharon K   3/27/01  11:39 PM they did not think it was really you either..

Sharon K   3/27/01  11:39 PM as soon as they went to the room.. the person
                                  left..

Sharon K   3/27/01  11:39 PM I think someone is impersonating you

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  11:40 PM How are they using my _monitor?

Sharon K   3/27/01  11:40 PM oh yeah.. I was wondering if anyone could have
                                  got ahold of your passwords

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  11:40 PM I've been thinking about changing my name

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  11:40 PM no one could've, unless they hacked into my
                                  system

Sharon K   3/27/01  11:41 PM I dunno..

Sharon K   3/27/01  11:41 PM it is not a big thing.. I wanted to let you
                                  know however..

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  11:41 PM I am glad you told me, too

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  11:41 PM let's pick me another name

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  11:41 PM I have wanted to change it

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  11:41 PM I wanted Kryptonite_monitor way back when I
                                  liked that song

Sharon K   3/27/01  11:41 PM I would like you to write an email to the
                                  FM,TL.. saying you have heard that someone has
                                  been around using your name... yaddy yaddy..

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  11:41 PM but I couldn't get it b/c of Tony (SuperMan)

Sharon K   3/27/01  11:42 PM really?

Sharon K   3/27/01  11:42 PM hell one of the new monitors name is JasonT...
                                  

Sharon K   3/27/01  11:42 PM I think they should change the new ones name

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  11:42 PM yup

Sharon K   3/27/01  11:43 PM heck.. there was a imposter going in as
                                  God_monitor

Sharon K   3/27/01  11:43 PM hehehe

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  11:43 PM Oh, my

Sharon K   3/27/01  11:43 PM ok thinking..

Sharon K   3/27/01  11:43 PM if you want to keep the same name.. just
                                  request a change of passwords..

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  11:43 PM you know, Puppet just emailed me the passwords

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  11:48 PM Yes, it is in the URL 

Sharon K   3/27/01  11:48 PM yeah.. thats it..

Sharon K   3/27/01  11:48 PM *S*

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  11:49 PM I've noticed that. That's why I would always
                                  minimize my screen when I would type it when I
                                  had a friend that used gay.com was over

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  11:49 PM I've always been very cautious about it all.

Sharon K   3/27/01  11:49 PM yeah... I am lucky.. there is noone around
                                  that would want it LOL

Sharon K   3/27/01  11:49 PM otherwise I am sloppy about it

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  11:50 PM ah, see I don't even write down the new ones
                                  when they are sent out.  I memorize them.

Sharon K   3/27/01  11:50 PM LOL I print them.. hahahahahah

Sharon K   3/27/01  11:50 PM you know how daft I am.. 

Sharon K   3/27/01  11:51 PM it is easy these days..

Sharon K   3/27/01  11:51 PM to remember them I mean

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  11:51 PM yeah

Sharon K   3/27/01  11:51 PM I don't hang out with any gay.com ppl... 

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  11:51 PM you know, this has all happened since I have
                                  had the cable modem.  I have Black ICE, I
                                  didn't think anyone could get it, or at least
                                  w/o my knowing

Sharon K   3/27/01  11:51 PM I have taken them and put them in my
                                  dayplanner as they are going to be showing the
                                  house though

Sharon K   3/27/01  11:52 PM I am thinking it is an error on gay.coms
                                  part..

Sharon K   3/27/01  11:52 PM we have had this kind of thing before

Terry_VB_m 3/27/01  11:52 PM but why would they pick my name of all
                                  monitors

                                  name up.. if it lets you make a name with   
                                  _monitor.. is is not working again

Sharon K   3/27/01  11:53 PM oh heck.. maybe you kicked them... or they

                                  won't do it

Terry_VB_m 3/29/01  12:02 AM then I make a trip to the container where the
                                  cookies are

Sharon K   3/29/01  12:03 AM LOL.. just move them to your computer.. will
                                  save you the trip.. or just eat them all

Terry_VB_m 3/29/01  12:04 AM I tell myself, "I'm only going to eat one." 
                                  So I eat the cookie and drink part of the
                                  milk.  Well, since there is milk left, I say
                                  I'm going to get another cookie to finish my
                                  milk off.  Then I finish the milk before the
                                  cookie and need more milk.  It's just a
                                  viscous cycle.

Sharon K   3/29/01  12:04 AM ROTFLMOA.. eat them all.. then you have no
                                  worries

Terry_VB_m 3/29/01  12:05 AM This is true.  There are actually only 3 left
                                  now...my aunt must've stopped by and took
                                  some.  I was kinda pissed when I went down and
                                  there weren't but 6 cookies.  I was like WTF?

                                  have surprised myself so much since I've been
                                  on this medicine at the ideas and thoughts I'm
                                  having.

Sharon K   3/31/01  11:19 PM I'd also just like to say that I've got first
                                  dibs on borrowing Sharon's new tiarra. *S*

                                  been on this medicine.  They don't know what
                                  in the hell to think. 

Sharon K   3/31/01  11:20 PM LOL well they best enjoy it

                                  going

Sharon K   3/31/01  11:21 PM I wish it would shut up

Terry_VB_m 3/31/01  11:22 PM I mean @ work these ideas are just coming and
                                  coming.

Terry_VB_m 3/31/01  11:22 PM I didn't know I was creative

Terry_VB_m 3/31/01  11:23 PM I describe it like where my mind was once like
                                  a mud puddle, it's like a crystal spring now.

Sharon K   3/31/01  11:24 PM that is just wonderful honey

Terry_VB_m 3/31/01  11:25 PM I know.  Instead of wanting to cry because of
                                  having feelings of no hope, I want to cry
                                  because I'm just so happy to be happy

Terry_VB_m 3/31/01  11:25 PM LOL

Sharon K   3/31/01  11:25 PM ok, where is the happy medium *S*

Terry_VB_m 3/31/01  11:26 PM I'm there.  

Terry_VB_m 3/31/01  11:27 PM I think I'm there.  Before I was so ecstatic I
                                  couldn't stand it, but now that "high" feeling
                                  has worn off, but I'm still getting the
                                  benefit of the medicine.

Sharon K   3/31/01  11:27 PM wonderful *S*

Terry_VB_m 3/31/01  11:28 PM I know.

Terry_VB_m 3/31/01  11:28 PM I guess it wasn't everyone else with the
                                  problem.  =)~

                                  to marry her, Sharon.

Terry_VB_m 3/31/01  11:37 PM I really don't want to, but I dont' want to
                                  file bankruptcy, and I just can't do it on my
                                  own.

                                  moving is not going to fix it

Terry_VB_m 3/31/01  11:40 PM I told her I was thinking about her today. 
                                  She asked did I see her doing something, and I
                                  said, well I really saw you scrubbing my
                                  shower.

Sharon K   3/31/01  11:41 PM another person means more money out

Terry_VB_m 3/31/01  11:41 PM If she moves here, I'll charge her $600 mo
                                  rent, and I'll make her pay one CC bill

Sharon K   3/31/01  11:41 PM CC?

Sharon K   3/31/01  11:41 PM what if she cannot get a job in the States?

Sharon K   3/31/01  11:42 PM have you thought of all this?

Sharon K   3/31/01  11:42 PM *smacking you*

Sharon K   3/31/01  11:42 PM LOL

Terry_VB_m 3/31/01  11:42 PM She'd have to have one before I'd marry her.

Sharon K   3/31/01  11:42 PM I will support you whatever you do

Terry_VB_m 3/31/01  11:42 PM She can get a work visa, then get a job, then
                                  move here.

Sharon K   3/31/01  11:43 PM she can get the visa and job and you can live
                                  with eachother for a few months and see????

Terry_VB_m 3/31/01  11:43 PM I don't wanna marry her Sharon, but I have
                                  $25,000 in debt right now, counting my student
                                  loan.  2 of my CC companies charge me 25 and
                                  27% interest.  I can't get ahead...not even
                                  sharing expenses with my Aunt and not having a
                                  car payment.

Sharon K   3/31/01  11:44 PM well, think of your sanity *S*

Terry_VB_m 3/31/01  11:44 PM I have ALWAYS prided myself on having good
                                  credit.

Sharon K   3/31/01  11:44 PM also a trial would be good

Terry_VB_m 3/31/01  11:44 PM and I don't want to live with that the rest of
                                  my life

Sharon K   3/31/01  11:44 PM yes, I understand what you are saying *S*

Terry_VB_m 3/31/01  11:44 PM Because they don't ask have you filed
                                  bankruptcy in the last 10 years on mortgage
                                  loans.

Terry_VB_m 3/31/01  11:44 PM It's HAVE YOU EVER

Sharon K   3/31/01  11:45 PM yes, true

Terry_VB_m 3/31/01  11:45 PM And I just see how the agents @ work have to
                                  go through so much hassle when they have
                                  bankruptcy.

Terry_VB_m 3/31/01  11:45 PM and the embarrassment

Terry_VB_m 3/31/01  11:45 PM I mean they use credit in SO many things
                                  today.

Sharon K   3/31/01  11:45 PM well, have her come for awhile.. see how it
                                  goes

Terry_VB_m 3/31/01  11:46 PM Should I make her put down a $2,500 good faith
                                  money?

Terry_VB_m 3/31/01  11:46 PM Kinda like a dowry

Terry_VB_m 3/31/01  11:48 PM she might rather I be gay

Sharon K   3/31/01  11:48 PM LOL why do you say that??

Sharon K   3/31/01  11:48 PM rather than living in the same house with a
                                  woman?

Terry_VB_m 3/31/01  11:48 PM No.  Marrying someone to defraud the gov't

Terry_VB_m 3/31/01  11:49 PM Hell, she told the preacher's wife the other
                                  day that she knew the computer I bought her
                                  for Christmas was the devil.  "Why else would
                                  I get so frustrated with it?" she asked.

Sharon K   3/31/01  11:49 PM Yikes!

Sharon K   3/31/01  11:49 PM Oh My!!!

Terry_VB_m 3/31/01  11:49 PM I know

Sharon K   3/31/01  11:50 PM lolol I have to laugh at that though

Terry_VB_m 3/31/01  11:50 PM I was talking to her last night on the phone
                                  and I laughed to.

Sharon K   3/31/01  11:50 PM we all think our puters should go to hell
                                  sometimes

Terry_VB_m 3/31/01  11:50 PM I said, My God Mom!  It is not the devil

Sharon K   3/31/01  11:50 PM LOL hahahaha

Sharon K   3/31/01  11:50 PM Laughing

Terry_VB_m 3/31/01  11:50 PM Then she started in on all the filth that is
                                  on the computer.

Sharon K   3/31/01  11:51 PM oh my.. tell her to look for the good in it

Terry_VB_m 3/31/01  11:51 PM and I said, but look @ it this way.  Think of
                                  it as God let someone create it so I could see
                                  my nephew Conner 320 miles away as he grows
                                  up.

Terry_VB_m 3/31/01  11:51 PM and then she said, "there's always some good
                                  in the devil's work."

Sharon K   3/31/01  11:51 PM yes and many things

Sharon K   3/31/01  11:51 PM LOL

Terry_VB_m 3/31/01  11:51 PM "That's the way he tricks people" She said

Sharon K   3/31/01  11:51 PM she is quick

Terry_VB_m 3/31/01  11:51 PM I know

Terry_VB_m 3/31/01  11:51 PM She's a religous fanatic.

Terry_VB_m 3/31/01  11:52 PM I told her

Sharon K   3/31/01  11:52 PM tell her to send it to me

Sharon K   3/31/01  11:52 PM I will smack the devil right out of it for her

Terry_VB_m 3/31/01  11:52 PM LOL

Sharon K   3/31/01  11:52 PM LOL

Sharon K   3/31/01  11:52 PM *G*

Terry_VB_m 3/31/01  11:53 PM She doesn't think she's a religous fanatic

Sharon K   3/31/01  11:53 PM uh huh

Sharon K   3/31/01  11:53 PM I have to get some sleep now hon

Sharon K   3/31/01  11:53 PM I doubt it.. but I have to try when I think I

Terry_VB_m 4/6/01   9:47 PM  Hey darlin'

                                  I am invisible to most everyone LOL

Terry_VB_m 4/6/01   9:48 PM  Shhhh, I won't say a word

Sharon K   4/6/01   9:48 PM  hey, did you get an email from puppet??

Terry_VB_m 4/6/01   9:48 PM  You know, I was thinking this evening, we need
                                  to schedule Terry & Sharon time...so that way
                                  we know that at a certain time on a certain
                                  day is the time just for us

Terry_VB_m 4/6/01   9:48 PM  Yes, about changing my password, saying it had
                                  been compromised.

Sharon K   4/6/01   9:49 PM  yes, she said that someone has been in your
                                  account????

Terry_VB_m 4/6/01   9:49 PM  *shrugs*  I dunno..unless it's now that I'm on
                                  a cable modem.  You know hackers.

Terry_VB_m 4/6/01   9:49 PM  Oh, speaking of which, a chatter from my home
                                  room just happened to mention that he could
                                  see my host.

Sharon K   4/6/01   9:49 PM  really?? heavens..

Terry_VB_m 4/6/01   9:50 PM  so I probed further (I was being sneaky) and
                                  then got him to send me the program.

Sharon K   4/6/01   9:50 PM  LOL oh ok.. you boys

Terry_VB_m 4/6/01   9:50 PM  I figured I could send it to Puppet & Eric and
                                  they can pass it on to our tech team

Terry_VB_m 4/6/01   9:50 PM  So they could program against that program.

Terry_VB_m 4/6/01   9:51 PM  Do you think i should, or do you think they
                                  already know people have programs that show
                                  every user's IP addy?

Sharon K   4/6/01   9:51 PM  great idea *S*

Sharon K   4/6/01   9:51 PM  I would send it.. cannot hurt hon

Terry_VB_m 4/6/01   9:51 PM  I couldn't get the program to work.

Terry_VB_m 4/6/01   9:51 PM  Said I was missing a file or something.  The
                                  guy that gave it to me came over and he
                                  couldn't figure it out, either.  I figured
                                  they would be able to find that file that it
                                  says I'm missing.

Sharon K   4/6/01   9:52 PM  yes, I bet they can.. *S*

Terry_VB_m 4/6/01   9:52 PM  Just send it to
                                  monitorrelations@onlinepartners.com ?

Sharon K   4/6/01   9:52 PM  go ahead this time and send it to
                                  puppet@onlinepartners..

Terry_VB_m 4/6/01   9:53 PM  oh, ok.  I'll bcc you on it.

Sharon K   4/6/01   9:53 PM  she reads that email as it comes in *W*

Terry_VB_m 4/6/01   9:53 PM  oh, kewl deal.

Sharon K   4/6/01   9:54 PM  kewl 

Terry_VB_m 4/6/01   9:54 PM  Yeah, that must've been the one she sent that
                                  msg about my password...cuz I replied and it
                                  has added that account to my address bookl.

Sharon K   4/6/01   9:54 PM  well, are you still getting married??

Terry_VB_m 4/6/01   9:54 PM  I talked to Spence about it.

Sharon K   4/6/01   9:54 PM  and?

Terry_VB_m 4/6/01   9:54 PM  She kind of let on like she thought I should
                                  file bankruptcy

Terry_VB_m 4/6/01   9:54 PM  she said she did 

Terry_VB_m 4/6/01   9:55 PM  just recently (between you and me, of course)

Terry_VB_m 4/6/01   9:55 PM  Should I address her as Puppet or Summer?

Terry_VB_m 4/6/01   9:55 PM  She signs her emails "Puppet"

Sharon K   4/6/01   9:55 PM  we call her Puppet

Terry_VB_m 4/6/01   9:55 PM  oh, so you don't even call her Summer

Sharon K   4/6/01   9:55 PM  that is how she has her voice mail and all 

Sharon K   4/6/01   9:55 PM  not anymore.. she likes puppet.. 

Terry_VB_m 4/6/01   9:55 PM  Oh, really?  She has her voice mail set up
                                  that way?

Sharon K   4/6/01   9:55 PM  uh huh..

Terry_VB_m 4/6/01   9:56 PM  cool

Terry_VB_m 4/6/01   9:56 PM  Well, she does work for gay.com  *S*

Sharon K   4/6/01   9:57 PM  uh huh LOL. she can have as many names as she
                                  likes....

Terry_VB_m 4/6/01   9:58 PM  lol

Terry_VB_m 4/6/01   9:58 PM  right

Sharon K   4/6/01   10:03 PM so, whatcha doin mister?

Terry_VB_m 4/6/01   10:03 PM sending that file to Puppet.

Sharon K   4/6/01   10:03 PM aw ok 

Terry_VB_m 4/6/01   10:18 PM I bcc'd you on it.

Terry_VB_m 4/6/01   10:18 PM I had to make sure it was perfect before I
                                  sent it.

Terry_VB_m 4/6/01   10:18 PM I hate that about me.  I'll be at work
                                  composing an email for 20 minutes.

Sharon K   4/6/01   10:19 PM uh huh.. that would be you darlin..

Terry_VB_m 4/6/01   10:19 PM I guess because I don't write letters really,
                                  unless it's to an Insurance Department for a
                                  state, and then they're usually just letters
                                  from agents.  Since I consider those emails
                                  letters, I have to sit down and write a letter
                                  like people used to do in olden times.

Terry_VB_m 4/6/01   10:19 PM and you know I have to have a letter perfect.

Terry_VB_m 4/6/01   10:20 PM I couldn't be a perfectionist otherwise.

Sharon K   4/6/01   10:20 PM yes, I do know that about you... how are you
                                  ever going to find anyone you can tolerate??
                                  hehehe

Terry_VB_m 4/6/01   10:20 PM Spence and I were talking about that the other
                                  night.

Terry_VB_m 4/6/01   10:20 PM I don't know, Sharon.  It's crazy

Terry_VB_m 4/6/01   10:20 PM Even the most pefect guy for me would do stuff
                                  to irritate my perfectionism.

Sharon K   4/6/01   10:20 PM how far are you from Philly??

Terry_VB_m 4/6/01   10:21 PM like 5 hours, I think

Sharon K   4/6/01   10:21 PM well, as long as you except him the way he is
                                  and visa versa.. you will be ok *S*

Terry_VB_m 4/6/01   10:21 PM I'm close to you than I am Philly
                                  

Terry_VB_m 4/6/01   10:21 PM That's just it, Sharon.  I find flaws.

Sharon K   4/6/01   10:21 PM well someday you won't...

Terry_VB_m 4/6/01   10:21 PM even if they're not there, I find
                                  SOMETHING...ANYTHING

Terry_VB_m 4/6/01   10:21 PM some day I'm going to be bald, old, and ugly
                                  and won't be able to find anyone then.

Sharon K   4/6/01   10:22 PM LOLOL 

Terry_VB_m 4/6/01   10:22 PM except some money-hungry teenie bopper after
                                  the fortune I've made for myself.

Sharon K   4/6/01   10:23 PM *shrug*
                                  
                                  with those really high expectations.. *sigh*

Terry_VB_m 4/6/01   10:23 PM You think I'm just afraid of committment?

Sharon K   4/6/01   10:23 PM that too..

Sharon K   4/6/01   10:23 PM Low self asteem..

Sharon K   4/6/01   10:23 PM esteem yikes

Terry_VB_m 4/6/01   10:24 PM because it's like as soon as I meet someone, I
                                  lure them in....I do anything to get their
                                  attention, then once they're in, I back off
                                  BIG TIME.

Sharon K   4/6/01   10:24 PM they were not a good enough challenge for
                                  you...

Terry_VB_m 4/6/01   10:24 PM I shut off all emotions when I think it's
                                  getting close to being something.

Terry_VB_m 4/6/01   10:24 PM Yup

Sharon K   4/6/01   10:24 PM too easy is boring...

Terry_VB_m 4/6/01   10:24 PM I have to constantly be challenged

Terry_VB_m 4/6/01   10:24 PM You're so right.

Sharon K   4/6/01   10:24 PM same here.. that is the way I led my life for
                                  so long..

Sharon K   4/6/01   10:24 PM I was bored..

Sharon K   4/6/01   10:24 PM I settle often..

Terry_VB_m 4/6/01   10:25 PM yup yup

Sharon K   4/6/01   10:25 PM I sometimes don't think there is anyone in
                                  life that can keep my mind stimulated...

Terry_VB_m 4/6/01   10:25 PM Not even me?

Sharon K   4/6/01   10:25 PM so, the answer is to have the world do that
                                  task in my mind

Sharon K   4/6/01   10:25 PM that way No Person can let me down..

Terry_VB_m 4/6/01   10:25 PM Wow!  That's exactly how I feel.

Sharon K   4/6/01   10:25 PM *S* it is a fact 

Terry_VB_m 4/6/01   10:26 PM *sigh of relief*  I'm so glad I know someone
                                  who knows what I'm going through.

Sharon K   4/6/01   10:27 PM *S*.. it does not make our lives easy.. but
                                  always interesting.. as long as you accept
                                  that that is how you are.. you will be ok 

Terry_VB_m 4/6/01   10:28 PM I guess knowing it is a big part of it
                                  all...and I've known that I was a
                                  perfectionist for some time.

Terry_VB_m 4/6/01   10:28 PM Many stories to tell you, my friend.

Terry_VB_m 4/6/01   11:19 PM Sharon, what's with this Georgia, 18-25
                                  (ONLY).  It's getting the old trolls up in
                                  arms.  They're all complaining.  What are the
                                  monitor guidelines?  Do we boot people over
                                  25?
