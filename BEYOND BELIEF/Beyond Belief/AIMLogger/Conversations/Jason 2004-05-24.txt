        He's such a whiner
jason-3: lol
Terry_VB: Dont' get me wrong.  I don't mind 
        someone complaining to me... everyone 
        does it.  It's because I love to help people.  
        But if you complain and someone gives 
        you advice, stop complaining until you've at
        least tried it
jason-3: that is sooo true
Terry_VB: but underneath all that, he is a good 
        person.  I hate that I always see the best in
        people
Terry_VB: so few people see their own 
        potential

Terry_VB: it's like beating my head against a 
        wall
jason-3: too cute
Terry_VB: wow, I even deleted his # from my 
        cell phone.  
Terry_VB: I thought I still had it
jason-3: wow you must have been mad
Terry_VB: now that I think about it, I was
Terry_VB: and the more I think about it, the 
        more i don't want you to meet him
jason-3: lol
Terry_VB: hrmm, he must not even have a 
        gay.com profile anymore.  I thought his s/n 
        was Dnvrguy2003
jason-3: oh ok
Terry_VB: ah... it's Dnvrguy2003 on AOL
jason-3: oh ok
Terry_VB: he's away right now
Terry_VB: add him to your list.  Who knows?  
        Maybe you'll like him

Terry_VB: I hope he doesn't get mad at me for 
        sending his picture to you
Terry_VB: ah fuck it, who cares
jason-3: lol
Terry_VB: so what is it about HIV+ that you find 
        attractive?

        room!!

jason-3: do you see me in a room now
Terry_VB: not now, no
Terry_VB: that's strange
Terry_VB: oooooo
jason-3: that is weird....hmmm
Terry_VB: you don't remember looking at the 
        rooms under Topics?
jason-3: i was looking at rooms and i kept 
        stopping to talk to people maybe i  clicked 
        in or something
Terry_VB: well, it was obviously not chance
Terry_VB: I don't believe in chance
jason-3: awww...you are too cute
Terry_VB: I'm glad you think so
Terry_VB: you're making my day
jason-3: :)
Terry_VB: so why are you online at this hour?
Terry_VB: do you work this morning?
jason-3: i couldnt sleep     nope,,,off for two 
        days
Terry_VB: I can't sleep, either
jason-3: :(
Terry_VB: it's all good.  I wouldn't have met you 
        had I not had insomnia.... and you wouldn't
        have complimented me and made my 
        whole day.  So it's all worked out
Terry_VB: I always get insomnia in the 
        springtime, though... just a vicious cycle
jason-3: me too
Terry_VB: do you know what time you were 
        born?
jason-3: no   i dont
Terry_VB: it's ok.  I was just curious
jason-3: :)
Terry_VB: so no boyfriend?
jason-3: nah  broke up
Terry_VB: how long ago?
jason-3: 6 nonths
Terry_VB: yeah, I didn't figure you had been on 
        the market long
jason-3: lol
Terry_VB: I've been on the shelf so long I've got 
        dust
Terry_VB: I broke up with my ex (also a Leo) in 
        May 4 years ago
jason-3: awww  :(   why did u break up
Terry_VB: he cheated on me the week before I 
        moved 450 miles to live with him... but 
        waited 3 weeks after I had already came 
        out to my mom, quit my job, and left my 
        friends and home to tell me
jason-3: that is aweful\
Terry_VB: but I forgave him for that... I told him 
        we're only human.  That wasn't the 
        problem.  The problem was after I moved 
        in with him, he decided he still wanted to 
        sleep with the escort he cheated on me 
        with
jason-3: wow!!
Terry_VB: and he wanted me to move back 
        home to VA Beach
jason-3: :(
Terry_VB: but I didn't have an apartment 
        anymore.... I had let its lease expire
Terry_VB: and I couldn't go live with my mom, 
        because it was VERY awkward after I 
        came out to her.  She's a fundamentalist 
        Christian
Terry_VB: But even through all that, I tried to 
        make it work... but some things just cant' 
        be fixed
jason-3: wow
Terry_VB: yeah.  we've had an interesting 
        relationship.  I actually still talk to him.  
jason-3: that is good though
Terry_VB: as much as I hate the things he 
        does, you never stop loving your first love
jason-3: that is sooo true
Terry_VB: I think I probably wouldn't have put up
        with so much with him had our sex not 
        been so mind-blowing
jason-3: lol.....i love great sex
Terry_VB: yeah, the first time Buddy and I met, it
        was only supposed to be a hookup... but 
        we ended up having sex for 12 hours
jason-3: oh wow...i like that
Terry_VB: yeah, it was intense
Terry_VB: but it is like that with me an Leos... 
        very hot
Terry_VB: can I ask how hung you are?
jason-3: 8"c  u?
Terry_VB: 7x5c
Terry_VB: I just had a feeling you were hung
Terry_VB: :-)
Terry_VB: I would've sent you a pic of it, but you 
        striked me as having class, so I didn't 
        want you to think I didn't
jason-3: yummy i like yours
jason-3: lol..i do have class but i have curiosity 
        too  lol
Terry_VB: lol
