\fs24\lang1033\langfe1033\cgrid\langnp1033\langfenp1033 {\f1\fs20\cf1 Terry_VB: Hi there
\par librascorp26: hi
\par Terry_VB: born on the cusp of Libra/Scorpio?
\par librascorp26: libra sun, scorpio rising
\par Terry_VB: ahhh, most people don't know that
\par Terry_VB: very cool
\par Terry_VB: I study Astrology is why I was curious
\par librascorp26: cool, sagittarius moon
\par Terry_VB: firey
\par librascorp26: makes for one fucked up cookie
\par Terry_VB: naw
\par Terry_VB: although the Libra Sun and Sag moon are contradictory energies
\par librascorp26: i wish i weren't the above
\par Terry_VB: I'm a Virgo, with a Sagittarius rising and Gemini moon
\par librascorp26: cool
\par Terry_VB: would you mind if I looked at your chart?
\par librascorp26: nope
\par librascorp26: 10/17/77
\par librascorp26: 8:31 am
\par librascorp26: fayetteville, NC
\par librascorp26: cumberland county
\par Terry_VB: thank you
\par Terry_VB: what's your first name?
\par librascorp26: andrew
\par Terry_VB: wow, you have a lot of planets in your 12th house
\par librascorp26: really
\par librascorp26: so that means?
\par Terry_VB: it means that a lot of your energies are hidden from others
\par librascorp26: i'm very introverted
\par Terry_VB: I can see that
\par librascorp26: :)
\par Terry_VB: which is not like a Libra
\par Terry_VB: Libras are generally outgoing social people
\par librascorp26: the scorpio influence is really strong here, more scorpio than libra 
\par         really
\par Terry_VB: you have 4 planets in Libra
\par librascorp26: my
\par Terry_VB: 3 planets in water signs (Cancer & Scorpio)
\par librascorp26: cool
\par librascorp26: i guess cancer explains my mood swings
\par Terry_VB: My Mars is in Cancer, too
\par Terry_VB: yeah, it does
\par librascorp26: i see
\par Terry_VB: do you feel safest at home?
\par librascorp26: yea
\par Terry_VB: that's a Mars in Cancer trait
\par Terry_VB: here's what it says about Libra Sun/Sagittarius Moon
\par librascorp26: but live by myself, thank god for a security system
\par librascorp26: ok
\par Terry_VB: An intellectual, you are usually preoccupied with ideas. However, you 
\par         rarely seek knowledge for its own sake. You tend to be didactic and try to 
\par         convert others to your ideas.
\par librascorp26: that's true
\par Terry_VB: In defending your ideas you display all the strength of a zealot. 
\par         Fortunately, your well- developed judgment tells you exactly where your 
\par         opinions are not welcome. You are by nature straightforward and don't profess 
\par         to be more than you are. 
\par librascorp26: yup
\par Terry_VB: Your genuine concern for people inclines you toward social work. It is 
\par         difficult for you to restrain yourself, and your better judgment is often hidden 
\par         beneath the flash of some new and not-too-wise inspiration.
\par Terry_VB: But you are a harmonious individual - that is, no serious conflict exists 
\par         between idea and action, between what you appear to be and what you are. 
\par librascorp26: all me
\par Terry_VB: wanna hear more?
\par Terry_VB: did I lose ya?
\par librascorp26: your 6'3" and i'm 5'9"
\par Terry_VB: just a few inches
\par Terry_VB: you not like tall guys?
\par Terry_VB: are you there?
\par librascorp26: yes, my computer froze
\par librascorp26: did you get my last im about being 5'9"
\par Terry_VB: yeah, I asked "do you not like tall guys?"
\par librascorp26: oh, yes i do
\par librascorp26: but tall guys usually don't like short guys
\par Terry_VB: well you found one that does
\par Terry_VB: I don't like guys my height
\par librascorp26: lol
\par Terry_VB: what's your email address?  I'm putting together a report for you
\par librascorp26: alfbaw
\par librascorp26: @earthlink.net
\par Terry_VB: you're a very interesting individual, I'm finding
\par librascorp26: ...complicated, enigmatic
\par Terry_VB: we're all complicated
\par librascorp26: don't like to have to explain myself either
\par Terry_VB: but yes, you are a bit of an enigma
\par Terry_VB: and you don't have to
\par librascorp26: like to be figured out
\par Terry_VB: You do?  I would have guessed you don't like to be figured out
\par librascorp26: only because most people are wrong
\par Terry_VB: I bet I wouldn't be
\par librascorp26: really now
\par librascorp26: :)
\par Terry_VB: my one friend said he's going to start calling me Mr. Peggy, because I 
\par         can peg anybody
\par librascorp26: well i'm hard to "peg"
\par Terry_VB: that's all right.  I've never been one to back down from a challenge
\par librascorp26: that had a strange double entendre
\par Terry_VB: lol, yes it did
\par Terry_VB: but it's all good
\par librascorp26: ;)
\par Terry_VB: so are you a pothead?
\par librascorp26: omg
\par Terry_VB: no?
\par librascorp26: big time
\par Terry_VB: me, too
\par librascorp26: betty is my drug and vice of choice
\par librascorp26: with sex coming a close second for vice
\par Terry_VB: sex is my biggest vice, then mary j
\par Terry_VB: I don't know who Betty is
\par Terry_VB: never been with her
\par librascorp26: same as mary j
\par Terry_VB: oh ok
\par Terry_VB: then we have the two same vices
\par librascorp26: and katherine betty is her snobby stepsister otherwise known as KB 
\par         (kindbud)
\par Terry_VB: ahhhh
\par Terry_VB: I learn something new every day
\par librascorp26: and you know what kb is i take it
\par Terry_VB: oh yeah
\par librascorp26: cool, i want to go to amsterdam for the cannabis cup at least once
\par Terry_VB: sweet.  I wouldn't mind going to that, either
\par Terry_VB: I'm going to send you a love, sex, and flirtation report too
\par librascorp26: sounds cool, love to read that stuff 
\par Terry_VB: listen to this... Sexuality at its best totally involves and overtakes you. For 
\par         this reason you may be attracted to some unconventional kinds of sex in which
\par         you control or are controlled by the situation. 
\par Terry_VB: Your feelings are very intense, but that can backfire if the affair does not 
\par         work out. If that happens, try not to hold a grudge against your former lover - 
\par         some affairs just don't work out, and neither of you is to blame. 
\par librascorp26: very true
\par Terry_VB: how long have you been single?
\par librascorp26:  4 months
\par Terry_VB: how long was the relationship?
\par librascorp26: 2 and a half years
\par Terry_VB: that's a long time in gay years
\par librascorp26: yea....would still be together if he didn't like the 3somes better than 
\par         sex with me
\par Terry_VB: you like threesomes?
\par librascorp26: nope
\par librascorp26: did it to satisfy him
\par librascorp26: i know how men are
\par Terry_VB: yeah, me either
\par Terry_VB: Threesomes suck in my opinion
\par Terry_VB: there is no intimacy there
\par Terry_VB: and if there is, someone is getting left out
\par Terry_VB: and if I'm not going to have intimacy, I'd rather not have sex
\par librascorp26: yup, like receiving 100 percent of the attention i give
\par Terry_VB: thank you!
\par Terry_VB: so what did you learn from this last relationship?
\par librascorp26: that it's impossible to satisfy men sexually over the long haul, so why 
\par         bother from the beginning
\par Terry_VB: well, I guess that's one way to look at it
\par librascorp26: and that life will probably be a series of successive relationships until
\par         you get aids or die
\par librascorp26: depressing huh
\par Terry_VB: not really
\par librascorp26: just factual
\par Terry_VB: I don't choose to look at it that way
\par Terry_VB: whoever decided a long time ago that we were meant to be with only one 
\par         person in this lifetime was either living a fantasy in their mind or in an unhappy 
\par         relationship but failing to see it
\par Terry_VB: relationships reflect back to us the things in us that we could not see 
\par         otherwise
\par Terry_VB: they each teach us a lesson about who we are and who we want to be
\par librascorp26: yea...
\par Terry_VB: but I am sorry that your ex hurt you
\par librascorp26: too bad it's never been my choice
\par Terry_VB: but it is your choice
\par librascorp26: to break up?
\par Terry_VB: weren't you unhappy?
\par librascorp26: with the fact the he lost attraction
\par Terry_VB: he didn't lose attraction with you... he just didn't realize what he had in 
\par         front of him
\par librascorp26: or that
\par Terry_VB: we all get complacent from time to time in relationships
\par Terry_VB: hang on.. need to pack the bong
\par librascorp26: :), silly
\par Terry_VB: where do you think all of this great advice comes from?
\par Terry_VB: it has to be Mary
\par librascorp26: right
\par Terry_VB: so what brought you into the Va beach room today?
\par librascorp26: just needed a change of pace, queens can be really vindictive in a 
\par         social manner when they perceive a threat, much like women
\par Terry_VB: I understand more than you know
\par Terry_VB: well, I'm glad you did come in our room, otherwise I'd have never met you
\par librascorp26: :), thx, and likewise
\par Terry_VB: it's not too often I connect with guys my own age
\par librascorp26: i date older myself
\par librascorp26: most aren't mature enough yet
\par Terry_VB: yeah, that's my thought process, too
\par librascorp26: or too dumb
\par Terry_VB: lol
\par librascorp26: but dumb comes in all ages
\par librascorp26: sorry if that sounds snobby
\par Terry_VB: you don't.  I know what you mean
\par librascorp26: cool
\par Terry_VB: there are a lot of gay men with the peter pan syndrome
\par librascorp26: what is that
\par Terry_VB: they dont' want to grow up
\par librascorp26: yea
\par Terry_VB: They get caught up in the drama of their lives and they forget what they're 
\par         really here for
\par Terry_VB: but enough about them... what are you going to do the rest of the day?
\par librascorp26: just chilling i guess
\par librascorp26: need to clean and such
\par librascorp26: laundry, oh what fun
\par Terry_VB: yeah, I just did that yesterday
\par Terry_VB: I don't know what I'm gonna do the rest of the day
\par librascorp26: get high
\par librascorp26: and horny
\par Terry_VB: well, besides those two
\par Terry_VB: those are given
\par Terry_VB: it kills me to intuitively know how hot you are in bed
\par Terry_VB: so passionate
\par Terry_VB: whew, the intensity
\par librascorp26: lol
\par librascorp26: if you like btms
\par Terry_VB: I like bottoms
\par Terry_VB: I'm a good top I hear
\par librascorp26: hmmm, :)
\par Terry_VB: I sent you my cock shots
\par Terry_VB: ;-)
\par librascorp26: to what address
\par librascorp26: nasty boy
\par Terry_VB: the same one I sent the others to
\par Terry_VB: lol
\par librascorp26: cool
\par Terry_VB: I can be nasty
\par Terry_VB: not the innocent Virgin I appear to be
\par librascorp26: uh oh
\par librascorp26: hold and let me see
\par Terry_VB: ok
\par Terry_VB: brb.  gotta go pee
\par Terry_VB: back
\par librascorp26: nasty boy
\par librascorp26: :)
\par Terry_VB: you like?
\par librascorp26: oh yeah
\par Terry_VB: cool
\par Terry_VB: I sent you some other pics just now... they're rated G, though
\par librascorp26: cool
\par Terry_VB: you have any more of you I could see?
\par librascorp26: i have yahoo messenger webcam
\par Terry_VB: even better!
\par librascorp26: you yahoo name
\par Terry_VB: terry_holliday
\par Terry_VB: what is yours?
\par }{
\par andrew_faircloth2000: hi
\par terry_holliday: there ya are
\par terry_holliday: woo hoo
\par terry_holliday: yeah, smack your ex in the head the next time you see him for me, please
\par andrew_faircloth2000: oh well, too late for that
\par terry_holliday: yup.  his loss
\par andrew_faircloth2000: so are you really high yet
\par terry_holliday: nah.... I'm trying to conserve until I get up with my guy today
\par andrew_faircloth2000: your "guy"
\par terry_holliday: my dealer
\par andrew_faircloth2000: i see
\par andrew_faircloth2000: does he have kb
\par terry_holliday: yeah, purple haze
\par terry_holliday: I saw those eyes
\par andrew_faircloth2000: oh my i want some
\par andrew_faircloth2000: it's a little heavy on the indica though
\par andrew_faircloth2000: more of a sativa guy here
\par terry_holliday: I have no clue what you just said, but I agree
\par andrew_faircloth2000: there are two different types of basic marijuana
\par andrew_faircloth2000: all based on country of origin
\par andrew_faircloth2000: indica strains are from the middle east, like iran irag afghanistan
\par andrew_faircloth2000: sativa strains are mostly from south america
\par terry_holliday: ahhh
\par terry_holliday: boy you're smart
\par andrew_faircloth2000: and they have 2 different highs
\par andrew_faircloth2000: sativa high is more uppety, energetic, makes your mind race from thinking you love music and being creative and doesn't make you as paranoid
\par andrew_faircloth2000: i like that one
\par andrew_faircloth2000: indica is more of a couch potato high
\par terry_holliday: ugh
\par terry_holliday: no, I don't like indica
\par andrew_faircloth2000: so you've had both if you reflect back on your experiences
\par terry_holliday: yeah
\par terry_holliday: no, I like the weed that makes me a genius
\par andrew_faircloth2000: good
\par andrew_faircloth2000: purple haze i think is mostly indica but is a hybrid
\par andrew_faircloth2000: so a little sativa too
\par andrew_faircloth2000: probably get effects of both
\par terry_holliday: I have never smoked it... He keeps telling me he's going to give me some to try
\par terry_holliday: but then he forgets
\par andrew_faircloth2000: first like sativa, then later get sleepy like indica
\par andrew_faircloth2000: well how much per quarter, $100
\par terry_holliday: I think so
\par andrew_faircloth2000: i'll split a 1/4 with ya
\par terry_holliday: ok
\par andrew_faircloth2000: 50 a piece, and i have a postal weight scale
\par terry_holliday: me, too
\par andrew_faircloth2000: to divide with
\par andrew_faircloth2000: then comes the problem of where to meet
\par terry_holliday: minor technicality
\par andrew_faircloth2000: are you in va beach
\par terry_holliday: yeah
\par andrew_faircloth2000: i'm about 2 hours away
\par terry_holliday: sounds like a nice road trip to me
\par andrew_faircloth2000: not too bad
\par terry_holliday: I believe my buddy Jason used to live in Greenville.  I get all those NC cities mixed up
\par andrew_faircloth2000: i knew of a jason here, music major
\par terry_holliday: Did you ever chat on gay.com when we had monitors?
\par andrew_faircloth2000: yea
\par terry_holliday: he was one in the NC room... Jason Sutton
\par andrew_faircloth2000: hmmm....not sure, the jas. i knew from va beach, had dark hair was tall, into music, drove a pontiac grand prix older red model, and worked at mall here
\par terry_holliday: naw, this Jason was from there
\par andrew_faircloth2000: nevermind
\par terry_holliday: but anyway... 2 hours is nothing
\par andrew_faircloth2000: nope
\par terry_holliday: I'm trying to think what the fastest way to get there is
\par terry_holliday: I guess i ought to find the purple haze first
\par andrew_faircloth2000: i can get directions from streets and trips
\par andrew_faircloth2000: just give your address
\par terry_holliday: You'll get a kick of this address.  1014 Smoke Tree Ln, Va Beach VA 23452
\par andrew_faircloth2000: how appropriate
\par terry_holliday: I know, right
\par terry_holliday: I said the developer must've been a pothead, too
\par andrew_faircloth2000: yup
\par andrew_faircloth2000: how likely is it that you can get it
\par terry_holliday: I dunno... I'll just have to call him and find out
\par andrew_faircloth2000: cool
\par terry_holliday: I wish my tomato plants would hurry up and bloom so I can stop going to the farmer's market each week
\par andrew_faircloth2000: you grow them?
\par terry_holliday: yeah, bought a baby bloomer and 400w metal halide light
\par terry_holliday: isn't hydro the way to go?
\par andrew_faircloth2000: oh my
\par andrew_faircloth2000: any weed in ther
\par andrew_faircloth2000: e
\par terry_holliday: that's what I meant by tomato plants
\par terry_holliday: I've got four female plants that are starting to bloom, and should be ready in another few weeks
\par andrew_faircloth2000: oh my
\par andrew_faircloth2000: you are a professional
\par terry_holliday: I guess I will be in a few weeks
\par andrew_faircloth2000: yup
\par andrew_faircloth2000: looking up purple hze now
\par terry_holliday: ok
\par terry_holliday: it's funny watching your eyes go back and forth as you read
\par andrew_faircloth2000: you are high
\par terry_holliday: just a little bit
\par terry_holliday: do you know what sour diesel is?
\par andrew_faircloth2000: no
\par andrew_faircloth2000: what
\par terry_holliday: he tried to explain it to me, but I'm not sure I understood what he said
\par terry_holliday: Puple haze in drones? droves?
\par andrew_faircloth2000: ?
\par andrew_faircloth2000: never heard of a drone or drove
\par terry_holliday: you got me... I'm trying to get him to explain it to me
\par terry_holliday: I'm on hold now
\par andrew_faircloth2000: k
\par andrew_faircloth2000: is that better than just normal purple haze
\par terry_holliday: that's what he said
\par andrew_faircloth2000: a drone?
\par andrew_faircloth2000: odd
\par terry_holliday: I'm gonna ask him
\par terry_holliday: he's coming back now
\par terry_holliday: or maybe not.  just got disconnected
\par andrew_faircloth2000: uh oh
\par terry_holliday: oh!!!  purple haze & hydro mixed
\par andrew_faircloth2000: oh yeah
\par andrew_faircloth2000: so just purple haze grown hydroponically
\par terry_holliday: he said a 1/4 is $125
\par andrew_faircloth2000: i would split it with ya
\par andrew_faircloth2000: for real
\par andrew_faircloth2000: is worth it
\par terry_holliday: ok, I don't think he knows... now he said no, 1/8 is $125
\par andrew_faircloth2000: for real
\par terry_holliday: that's bullshit, I'll grow it myself
\par andrew_faircloth2000: 125 per quarter
\par andrew_faircloth2000: or eight
\par terry_holliday: he just said 1/8
\par terry_holliday: I told him he's going to have to get me a sample before I spend that kind of money
\par andrew_faircloth2000: that can't be, i bought 1/4 of hydroponic white widow from New York for 125
\par terry_holliday: yeah, I think he's wrong
\par andrew_faircloth2000: that's twice the going rate for hydro kb
\par andrew_faircloth2000: he must be fucked up
\par terry_holliday: I think he was
\par terry_holliday: he usually is
\par andrew_faircloth2000: even 125 for a quarter is steep
\par terry_holliday: I will ask one of my other friends who has contacts
\par andrew_faircloth2000: ok
\par terry_holliday: I shop around
\par andrew_faircloth2000: cool
\par terry_holliday: hrmm, was looking to see how compatible we are

\par andrew_faircloth2000: yea
\par terry_holliday: wow, I didn't know this...A
part from hermaphrodites, male flowers also will be formed on basic female plants under certain conditions at the very end of their life cycle. When female plants are not fertilized at the very end of their life cycle, they will form male flowers to polli
nate themselves, so assuring offspring for the next season.
\par andrew_faircloth2000: the jamie lee curtis of the plant world, neat
\par andrew_faircloth2000: well, i found out purple haze doesn't exist anymore
\par andrew_faircloth2000: only other strains sold under it's name
\par terry_holliday: really?  that's interesting
\par terry_holliday: why?
\par andrew_faircloth2000: modern day hybrids off the original purple haze strain
\par andrew_faircloth2000: so anywhere from 50/50 sativa/indica to 100 percent sativa
\par andrew_faircloth2000: so you could even get nonhydroponic and it should still be very good
\par andrew_faircloth2000: sativa makes the difference
\par andrew_faircloth2000: i'd take schwag sativa over hydro kb indica anyday
\par terry_hollida
y: Imported from South Africa, produced in Holland. Exclusively inbred, never hybridized, 100% Sativa. Large long bud leaves, buds are also large and long with lots of resin. A sweet licorice or anise flavor. "Up" high similar to Thai. High yields. Well s
uited for out crossing with late bloomers to produce earlier flowering. Also does very well under artificial light.
\par terry_holliday: that's the Durban Poison
\par andrew_faircloth2000: ok
\par terry_holliday: it's $75 for 10 seeds
\par andrew_faircloth2000: wow
\par terry_holliday: they're feminized seeds
\par andrew_faircloth2000: hmm
\par andrew_faircloth2000: so are you buying today
\par terry_holliday: naw, just reading right now.  
\par andrew_faircloth2000: , k, didn't know if you were serious or not
\par terry_holliday: why?  you can get some somewhere else?
\par andrew_faircloth2000: nope
\par terry_holliday: ah ok
\par terry_holliday: I didn't realize there were so many differen strains
\par andrew_faircloth2000: yea, white widow is the best
\par terry_holliday: I haven't seen that one listed
\par andrew_faircloth2000: one hit and i was high for hours
\par terry_holliday: it's only $45 per 10 seeds
\par terry_holliday: The most rewarded variety of recent years in Holland. The plants are white with THC glands, even on big parts of the fan leaves. A very soft smoke and great high. Very potent. 
\par andrew_faircloth2000: very true
\par terry_holliday: so are you high now?

\par terry_holliday: it lasted a year an a half
\par terry_holliday: until I moved in with him

\par andrew_faircloth2000: oh my gosh
\par terry_holliday: yeah, and I even forgave him for that

\par terry_holliday: unless I was just a glutton for punishment
\par andrew_faircloth2000: yea
\par terry_holliday: but after that relationship ended, I made a promise to myself that the next time I gave someone the title of my boyfriend, that would be it
\par terry_holliday: and I haven't found anyone worth of that title yet
\par terry_holliday: worthy
\par terry_holliday: well, anyone worthy that wanted to give me the time of day
