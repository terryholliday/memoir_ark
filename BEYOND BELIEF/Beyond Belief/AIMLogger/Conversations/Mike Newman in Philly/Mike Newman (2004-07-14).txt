VirginiaDevil: uh huh
Terry_VB: and couldn't find your email address
Terry_VB: and for some reason came in here, 
        and voila, there you were
VirginiaDevil: lol
VirginiaDevil: you want my email?
Terry_VB: yeah
VirginiaDevil: chuckywearer@yahoo.com
Terry_VB: it's gettin freaky just how connected I 
        seem to be to you
VirginiaDevil: hmmm- it is weird
VirginiaDevil: but a good weird
Terry_VB: so you are horny?
VirginiaDevil: babe its gettin difficult to keep the
        head on my shoulders up....let alone any 
        other appendage
Terry_VB: that's good.  
VirginiaDevil: heehee
Terry_VB: if you can't get it up, you can't get in 
        trouble
VirginiaDevil: totally
Terry_VB: sometimes I wish I couldn't get it up
Terry_VB: but I can always get it up
VirginiaDevil: there is some type of capsul that I
        got after I was circumsized that you break 
        and it makes your erection go down - but 
        they are perscribed
Terry_VB: naw, I just need to work on my self 
        control
VirginiaDevil: or that :) 
Terry_VB: I'm gonna try to get up early enough 
        so we can have lunch before I go to work 
VirginiaDevil: ok - remember - no pressure
Terry_VB: lol
VirginiaDevil: :)
Terry_VB: Of course there's pressure.  I want to
        hang out with you
VirginiaDevil: heehee
VirginiaDevil: oh damn, my doggie is barkin
Terry_VB: what's goin on?
VirginiaDevil: the dog is emotional - he wanted 
        to be back here with me
VirginiaDevil: just got him
Terry_VB: awww
VirginiaDevil: poor little doggie
Terry_VB: well, you must make him feel good
VirginiaDevil: I think hes just having separation 
        anxiety from mom being gone
VirginiaDevil: Im just his next best thing, lol
Terry_VB: well, that's all that matters right 
        now... at least in his world
VirginiaDevil: true
VirginiaDevil: hmm
Terry_VB: what?
VirginiaDevil: now that I look at him - he's gettin
        pudgy
Terry_VB: lol
Terry_VB: don't judge the dog
VirginiaDevil: lol
Terry_VB: he doesn't need your shit.  Here he 
        is left all alone by his mommy at such a 
        young age.... it's all he can do to keep it 
        together, and now you're calling him fat
Terry_VB: Geesh
VirginiaDevil: the damn dog is probably 77 in 
        doggie years, and he cant see a damn 
        thing -- so Im sure he doesnt care, lol
Terry_VB: lol
Terry_VB: oh
VirginiaDevil: p.s. - I like the guys in your hot list
Terry_VB: cool
Terry_VB: the guy Jamie in there I have been in 
        love with online for 4 years now
VirginiaDevil: awwww
Terry_VB: but he's disappeared in those 4 
        years
Terry_VB: he just came back in my life a few 
        months ago.  He's still bisexual and in the 
        closet
Terry_VB: he's only had ONE gay experience
Terry_VB: so he's just fun to pass the time
VirginiaDevil: lol
Terry_VB: I could never date someone with that
        kind of record with the record I've got
VirginiaDevil: lol, right? all of a sudden the 
        word whore would be flashin in my mind if 
        I was in a situation like that
Terry_VB: and we talk... but it's always about 
        nothing.  He's a Gemini... they're 
        superficial
Terry_VB: Yup
Terry_VB: we are so judgmental
VirginiaDevil: lol
Terry_VB: do you know how many guys you've 
        been with?
VirginiaDevil: umm, in the past two weeks I do
VirginiaDevil: but I prefer not to think about it
Terry_VB: lol, ok
VirginiaDevil: do you ?
Terry_VB: God, no.  I stopped keeping track in 
        1998 and I was up to 25 then
Terry_VB: I don't even know if I could guess?
Terry_VB: and you're the only person I know 
        that I could admit that to and not be 
        embarrassed about it
VirginiaDevil: aww
VirginiaDevil: Im sure for me it has to be close 
        to 200
Terry_VB: I think about it sometimes
VirginiaDevil: god
VirginiaDevil: lets talk about something else - 
        that alright? lol
Terry_VB: we can, sure.  It will come up again
VirginiaDevil: Im sure it will
Terry_VB: we've come to each other to raise 
        our consciousness
Terry_VB: this much I can see already
VirginiaDevil: totally
Terry_VB: the rest has to be spoonfed
Terry_VB: but you will not likely forget this trip to
        Va Beach... and not just from the 
        experience of meeting me
VirginiaDevil: true
Terry_VB: there is a lot you cannot see yet
Terry_VB: I see you like a caterpillar trying to 
        get out of its cocoon
Terry_VB: or a butterfly, rather
VirginiaDevil: really?
Terry_VB: yeah, you're breaking free of an old 
        cycle
Terry_VB: one day you will look back at this trip 
        with amazement of all you take from it
Terry_VB: not to get TOO deep on ya
Terry_VB: ;-)
VirginiaDevil: salright. I like it :) 
Terry_VB: well, whenever you're ready to know 
        more, all you have to do is ask.  I can't 
        always tell you HOW I know, but I do know 
        that I'm pretty intuitive
VirginiaDevil: alright - cool
Terry_VB: I just keep reminding myself that 
        you're only 22
VirginiaDevil: lol
Terry_VB: but I think it's good that you're at this 
        point in your life at 22.  It just reaffirms my 
        vision of your success
VirginiaDevil: ya know something weird
Terry_VB: what's that?
VirginiaDevil: talking with andrew last week - 
        he said after I told him what I wanted to do 
        - that he had a feeling that I would do well
Terry_VB: that's not weird, boo.  That's because
        Andrew is "sensitive" too
VirginiaDevil: lol
Terry_VB: What you need to make yourself 
        conscious of is you are creating these 
        experiences that you have.  There is no 
        chance.  Like attracts like.  The people you 
        are bringing to you now are here to teach 
        you something about yourself
Terry_VB: when you stop thinking of your life as
        one chance happening after another, 
        things begin to light up... to either affirm 
        what we believe
VirginiaDevil: I think youre going to become my 
        new councellor - forget the one I have in 
        philly ;)
Terry_VB: lol
Terry_VB: yeah, I really should start doing this 
        for $$.  That's what my psychic told me
Terry_VB: I just always seem to do it for my 
        friends
VirginiaDevil: thats ok too
Terry_VB: yeah, it's all good
Terry_VB: what are you doin?
VirginiaDevil: stareing at the puter screen
VirginiaDevil: lol
VirginiaDevil: thinking about food
Terry_VB: feeding your emotions?
VirginiaDevil: no - my BELLY
Terry_VB: lol
VirginiaDevil: :) 
Terry_VB: you remember my friend Mike from 
        the Cactus?
VirginiaDevil: yes
Terry_VB: look at his profile
Terry_VB: http://my.gay.com/nissan-nole
Terry_VB: I was in love with him for 2 years 
        before I finally accepted that he only 
        wanted to be my friend
VirginiaDevil: well SHIT
VirginiaDevil: might cut and paste that
Terry_VB: lol
Terry_VB: sounded pretty good, huh?
VirginiaDevil: totally
Terry_VB: he's a good catch
Terry_VB: *clears throat*
VirginiaDevil: lol - wasnt sure if I need to read 
        that right now - but it was good :) 
VirginiaDevil: lol
VirginiaDevil: just thinking about it is all
Terry_VB: what's it making you think?
VirginiaDevil: very good point
VirginiaDevil: points
Terry_VB: like?
VirginiaDevil: oh jeez he wants specifics :) 
VirginiaDevil: asking for advice in the right 
        places
Terry_VB: Yes, Virgo = Details
VirginiaDevil: lol
Terry_VB: well, for one, you don't need to be a 
        master to speak of mastery
Terry_VB: I can give great relationship advice 
        that works, but I can't be in a good 
        relationship myself to save my ass
VirginiaDevil: lol
Terry_VB: I think it's a great profile
Terry_VB: I just think he has a lot to learn still
Terry_VB: but he is also only 23
VirginiaDevil: true
Terry_VB: but for his age, he's very mature
VirginiaDevil: totally
VirginiaDevil: Terry - keep me from making a 
        possible mistake
Terry_VB: ok
Terry_VB: Only there are no mistakes.  There's 
        what we do and what we don't do
Terry_VB: what is the situation?
VirginiaDevil: could meet up with this guy after 
        he gets off work in two hours
Terry_VB: I thought you were tired?
VirginiaDevil: I AM!
VirginiaDevil: the little voice would rather have 
        some food and fall asleep in front of the tv
Terry_VB: but?
VirginiaDevil: the penis wants to meet Mr. 8 
        Inches
Terry_VB: ah, you're a bottom?
VirginiaDevil: Im vers
VirginiaDevil: lol
Terry_VB: *nods*
Terry_VB: who is Mr. 8"?
VirginiaDevil: Im slightly embarassed to say
Terry_VB: it's me
Terry_VB: come on
VirginiaDevil: mind you Ive only seen his cock 
        which is not enough to make me "come"
Terry_VB: who is he?
VirginiaDevil: BLOWMEBY
Terry_VB: his dick is no 8"
Terry_VB: that looks like 6 at best
VirginiaDevil: lol
VirginiaDevil: the 39 is a red flag though
Terry_VB: you don't want him
VirginiaDevil: nope
Terry_VB: My dick is much bigger
VirginiaDevil: heehee, nice
VirginiaDevil: so the next time you and I talk - 
        remind me about being a timid top
Terry_VB: you're a timid top?
VirginiaDevil: yeah
Terry_VB: but once you get going, you're wild?
VirginiaDevil: yeah, sometimes :) 
Terry_VB: how big are you?
VirginiaDevil: thats what Im timid about
VirginiaDevil: well, one of the things
Terry_VB: so are you going to tell me?
VirginiaDevil: about 5.5
VirginiaDevil: I donno how thick around
Terry_VB: why are you timid about that?
VirginiaDevil: bbeeecauuse
Terry_VB: ok
VirginiaDevil: we'll say moderately thick
Terry_VB: nice
