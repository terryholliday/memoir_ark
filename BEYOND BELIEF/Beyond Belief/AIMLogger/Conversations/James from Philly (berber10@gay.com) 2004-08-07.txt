Terry_VB: hi there
berber10: hey
Terry_VB: how's it going?
berber10: doing well, and yourself?
Terry_VB: doing pretty good.  killin some time on a 
        Friday night
Terry_VB: nothing else to do, so I'm checkin out the 
        hotties
berber10: yeah...I hear ya
Terry_VB: so are you visiting from Philly?
berber10: yeah....came down to see my parents
Terry_VB: that's cool.  how long are you going to be 
        here?
berber10: will be here until next Friday...then going 
        backpacking in Oregon before heading back to 
        Philly
Terry_VB: oh that sounds like fun
Terry_VB: have you ever been hiking there before?
berber10: yeah....been to Crater Lake and also Mt 
        Hood
Terry_VB: are you going by yourself or with friends?
berber10: my best friend
Terry_VB: that's cool
Terry_VB: I haven't been hiking in years
Terry_VB: I grew up in WV, so I used to go alot when I 
        lived there
berber10: yeah, I am looking 4ward to it...I used to go 
        all the time when i was in undergrad at UVA
berber10: it was so close to Skyline Drive
Terry_VB: yeah, that's such a beautiful area
berber10: the mountains here in PA are not really 
        mtns...not that the ones in VA are really tall, but 
        they are compared to PA...the highest elevation 
        here is only 1500'
berber10: but the countryside outside is Philadelphia 
        is picturesque
berber10: outside OF
Terry_VB: I haven't really seen outside of Philly, but I 
        didn't want to take any pictures when I was there
Terry_VB: but maybe I caught Philly on a bad day
berber10: HAHAHAH...the skyline is cool
Terry_VB: is that to distract you from looking at the 
        flying trash through the streets?
berber10: hahahaha....they have a crew down in 
        CEnter  City that's always sweeping the 
        streets...that's the one semi-clean part of town
Terry_VB: well, I don't want to diss your city.  I'm sure 
        it's good parts outweigh the bad
berber10: the area around PENN is about to get extra 
        trashy in a couple of weeks when all of those 
        damn undergrads come back to campus
berber10: It's not my city really....I'm a VA boy
Terry_VB: that's cool.  I am, too
Terry_VB: so what are you doing up so late?  Did you 
        go out?
berber10: I went up to Richmond to see some 
        friends...got back here late....just messing around
        on my dad's PC
Terry_VB: I see.  Did you have fun up in Richmond?
berber10: yeah....we went to dinner in the Bottom and 
        then then barhopped a little after that
Terry_VB: cool.  I spent the evening down at the 
        oceanfront with my friends
berber10: how long have you lived in VAB?
Terry_VB: since 1997
berber10: military?
Terry_VB: naw, I moved here from WV, which is where
        I grew up
berber10: ok...what made you move there?  Job? 
        College?
Terry_VB: to broaden my horizons basically.  I just 
        kind of outgrew where I grew up and had some 
        relatives that have lived here about 15 years... so 
        when I finished college, I up and moved here
Terry_VB: and I finally decided to buy my house a 
        couple years ago, so I guess here is home now
berber10: cool...good for you....even though VA is my 
        home, I don't think I'm coming back to live
Terry_VB: nah, you gotta go forward not back
berber10: yeah, and I hope this Ivy League degree will
        open some doors for me
Terry_VB: sorry, I'm back.  had to pee and get 
        something to drink
berber10: HAHAHAHAHAHA
Terry_VB: but I'm sure your degree will open lots of 
        doors
Terry_VB: I guess I better get to bed.  My thoughts are 
        turning to sex, and it's 3 a.m.
berber10: mine are always turning to sex...regardless 
        if it's 3am or 3pm
Terry_VB: lol, right
Terry_VB: I hear ya
Terry_VB: mine too, but more so at this hour
Terry_VB: maybe we can meet before you leave?
Terry_VB: I'm pretty good company
berber10: yeah?  cool....yeah, I'd like that....I'm going to
        be in NC for a few days visiting some family down
        there, but will be back on Tues...actually I won't be
        leaving until next Sat
Terry_VB: ok.  I'm off Fri/Sat next week
Terry_VB: you going to NC today?
berber10: yeah, later this afternoon
Terry_VB: well I hope to get to meet you
berber10: you have a cell#?  I probably won't be online
        while I am down  there?
Terry_VB: 757-816-0877
berber10: sweet, I will call u when I am back here in 
        Hampton Roads
Terry_VB: good deal
Terry_VB: out of curiosity (and so I can j/o to the 
        fantasy)... what do you like sexually?
berber10: depends on the dude/mood...but can 
        include things like hot 
        showers/massage/kissing/oral/nipple play/prefer
        top
berber10: and you?
Terry_VB: I like really intimate/intense sex... kissing, 
        massage, oral, vers
berber10: sweet
Terry_VB: how hung are you?
berber10: 8"
berber10: u?
Terry_VB: sweet.  7x5 here
Terry_VB: would you like to see it?
berber10: yeah....richvadL2@yahoo.com
Terry_VB: sent
Terry_VB: I'm guessing you don't have any other pics 
        b/c you're away from home?
berber10: hold on...I have some in my 'sent' folder I 
        think...lemme check here
Terry_VB: ok
berber10: sent
Terry_VB: cool   thank you
Terry_VB: I like G pics
Terry_VB: I can visualize your 8" cock
berber10: hehehehehehe
Terry_VB: when is your birthday?
berber10: march26
Terry_VB: cool.  lots of sexual energy
Terry_VB: I always find Aries hot
berber10: lol
Terry_VB: but you are exceptionally hot
berber10: thanks, dude....you're cute yourself
Terry_VB: thank you
Terry_VB: so you have a ring on your finger.  are you 
        hitched?
berber10: uh, no....that is a ring that a friend made for 
        me
Terry_VB: ah, that's cool
berber10: yeah, she was an art major at VCU
Terry_VB: what are you studying to be?
berber10: if I was hitched, I would not be hanging out 
        in gay chat rooms...HA HA...I am getting my 
        graduate degree in International Affairs
Terry_VB: well, that's very commendable.  Lots of guys
        who are do
Terry_VB: if I was hitched, gay.com is the last place I'd
        be
berber10: gay anything is the last place i'd be if I had a
        man I wanted to keep
Terry_VB: yup
Terry_VB: I feel ya
Terry_VB: what city are you in here?
berber10: that's why I'd rather be single if I know I am 
        not ready to make a commitment to 1 person
Terry_VB: oh no, I totally agree
berber10: you mean on gay.com?
Terry_VB: no, are you in VB/Norfolk?
berber10: no, my parents live near Yorktown
Terry_VB: I see.  So you're up there in the country
berber10: hehehehehehe...yeah....country boy....funny 
        thing since I live in the middle of the 5th biggest 
        city in the US
Terry_VB: country boy at heart with big city dreams
berber10: good way to put it
berber10: LOL
Terry_VB: that's a good combination, though
berber10: when I moved up here about a year ago, 
        one of my friends in Richmond told me not to get 
        in the middle of downtown Philly and throw my 
        hat in the air...a la Mary Tyler Moore
Terry_VB: lol
Terry_VB: so did you?
berber10: no
berber10: I'm a bit more ladylike than Mary
berber10: LOL!!!!
Terry_VB: lol
Terry_VB: I can see you have class
berber10: my parents taught me well
Terry_VB: well, you can have the best parents and turn
        out a rotten apple.  It was your choice to be the 
        way you are
berber10: yes, that's so true...take my oldest sister, for
        example....biggest FUCKING loser on the face of 
        the earth...tremendous dissapointment to my 
        parents
Terry_VB: well, try not to judge others for the paths 
        they choose.  Not everyone can be as ambitious 
        or desire as much as you
berber10: yeah....but she's squandered so many 
        opportunites, and has made the same mistakles 
        OVER and OVER!
Terry_VB: but I know what you mean
berber10: she grates me
Terry_VB: I can tell
berber10: grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
berber10: lol
Terry_VB: just try to see that her way isn't your way, but
        it's the way she's going.  
berber10: I don't even like being in the same room 
        with her
Terry_VB: that's too bad
Terry_VB: though I have had similar relationships with
        my brother/sister
Terry_VB: they are rednecks
Terry_VB: and I have no real prejudices
berber10: I get along with my other sister and my 2 
        brothers ...she's the only one that is so goddamn 
        irresponsible
berber10: I am close to all of  them
berber10: 'cept for her
Terry_VB: you should consider forgiving her for her 
        faults and try opening your heart to the possibility 
        that things might change
berber10: God knows, I have tried
Terry_VB: well, remember forgiveness is not for the 
        other person, it's for yourself
Terry_VB: and true forgiveness means forgetting it 
        ever happened
berber10: she screwed me out of $4000 and told my 
        parents that I'm gay...so I guess I'm just a *little* 
        angry still
Terry_VB: but what if everything happens for a 
        reason?
berber10: oh, yeah,,,,she got my money, never paid 
        me back one read cent...told my parents before I 
        was ready to come out
berber10: read=red
Terry_VB: you were ready or it wouldn't have 
        happened
Terry_VB: unless you are a victim?
Terry_VB: which I know you are not
berber10: luckily they took it way better than I 
        imagined...they've been awesome as a matter of 
        fact
Terry_VB: there is good in everything... even when we 
        choose not to see it
Terry_VB: The past is only what you think of it
berber10: but that was up to me to tell them...NOT her
Terry_VB: you're right.  You feel cheated
berber10: and I think she sucks for doing that to me
Terry_VB: but she did you a favor, because you were 
        scared
berber10: not only that...she went out and told a whole
        bunch of people 
Terry_VB: because she thought she was hurting you
Terry_VB: but she didn't realize she was freeing your 
        spirit
berber10: people that  I never would have told as it's 
        none of their business
Terry_VB: but she told the truth
Terry_VB: the truth can never hurt you
Terry_VB: You should never worry about what others 
        say about you.  You have no power to change 
        people's thoughts... you can only change your 
        reactions to what happens in your life
berber10: thanks, Dr Phil
berber10: ;-)
Terry_VB: no, Dr. Terry
berber10: still does not change the fact I don't like the 
        bitch
Terry_VB: ok, that's fair enough
Terry_VB: just know that you are only hurting yourself 
        by holding those feelings
berber10: maybe so, But I don't see it as such....
Terry_VB: well, maybe in time you will
berber10: I don't miss our relationship
Terry_VB: there you go.  
Terry_VB: anger is usually a result of hurt
Terry_VB: you miss her relationship so mad that you 
        are finding every fault you can to justify the hurt 
        feelings you have?
Terry_VB: ooos... so much
berber10: well, her glaring faults don't help the 
        situation
Terry_VB: yes, but love is unconditional
Terry_VB: in spite of those flaws
berber10: not when I keep getting hurt
berber10: my response is to throw up a wall
Terry_VB: no doubt.  you are a warrior
berber10: so you can't get in or over to ever hurt me 
        again
Terry_VB: yup
berber10: and that
Terry_VB: the shields go up
berber10: 's what I have done with her
Terry_VB: well, I hope you let them down one day
Terry_VB: and I didn't mean to pull so much out of you 
        in our first conversation
berber10: i speak to her when i see her, but that's 
        really it...I don't share anything about my personal
        life with her anymore..and i 've even asked my 
        mom not to mention my name in her presence
berber10: she's hurt me to the point where I just want 
        her out of my life
Terry_VB: very well.  accept you are going different 
        ways, but let go of the hurt/anger.  It's not good.
berber10: that's the part I'm not good at...letting go of 
        my anger...It's not like it burns at me inside...I 
        basically just shut down with people that screw 
        me over
Terry_VB: well, it will burn inside of you whether you 
        acknowledge it's there or not.... I see it.  
berber10: so, like what am I supposed to do...just 
        forget that:
Terry_VB: yes
Terry_VB: forgiveness is so empowering
Terry_VB: you are taking the power away from her and
        giving it back to yourself
Terry_VB: The best way to find those feelings are to 
        look at the good things instead of focusing on the
        bad
Terry_VB: when you start sending good vibes, it will 
        just magically open up and you'll be able to 
        forgive her
Terry_VB: you will not only forgive her, you will thank 
        her one day
berber10: 1 she screwed me out of 4000  2- never 
        paid me back   3- told everyone that I am gay 4- 
        let me drive around in an uninsured car for 6 
        months w/out telling me (and never apologized, 
        BTW)...what, am I just supposed to let all of that 
        go and let her back into my life....uh uh...no way....I
        refuse to let her hurt me again
berber10: I don'
berber10: t trust her
Terry_VB: I totally understand.  But what I'm talking 
        about is a state of being where no one can hurt 
        you
berber10: I can forgive...but i can't forget....that's what 
        keeps the wall up....I don't ever see us being 
        close again
Terry_VB: I hope you remember this conversation 
        when it happens... but there will come a day 
        when you will look at all of this as good.
Terry_VB: and maybe you won't
berber10: like, I never see us going to another Janet 
        Jackson concert like we did 7 years ago
berber10: before i knew what a horrible person she is
Terry_VB: then you are limiting yourself greatly
Terry_VB: :-\
berber10: why?  I have plenty of friends that will go to 
        see Janet with me
Terry_VB: lol
berber10: LOL
Terry_VB: I like you
berber10: ;-)
Terry_VB: don't necessarily agree with you
Terry_VB: but I usually don't with Aries... that's why we 
        click
berber10: well, why don't *YOU* forgive her for me?  
        and you two can go see Janet when she tours 
        again
berber10: HAHAHAHA
Terry_VB: I wish I could
berber10: awwwww....do you want to give her a hug?
Terry_VB: no, but I do want to give you one
berber10: ;-)
berber10: that's sweet
Terry_VB: my hugs are therapeutic I hear
berber10: I give a pretty mean one myself
Terry_VB: I'll bet
Terry_VB: well I had no idea I would be staying up till 4
        a.m. pyschoanalyzing a hot guy from Philly tonight
Terry_VB: thought I wanted to get laid, but this was 
        much better
berber10: but not to her...she gets the fake-Britney 
        Spears-I-really-don't-want-to-hug-you-but-the-cameras-are-rolling-please, 
        don't really touch me- kind of hug
Terry_VB: lol
Terry_VB: exactly
Terry_VB: so is your name Rich?
berber10: no, james
Terry_VB: cool.  *shaking hand*  you're quite an 
        outstanding gentleman
Terry_VB: I admire your passion
berber10: *handshake returned*....wow, this was 
        cool...an actual intelligent conversation with a 
        good looking dude...WHO KNEW?
Terry_VB: I know, right.  I always heard stories that it 
        really happened
Terry_VB: now i'm a believer
berber10: hahahahaha
Terry_VB: well, I had a hunch when I saw your picture
Terry_VB: even though I couldn't see your eyes
Terry_VB: but then once I did, it just confirmed what I 
        thought
berber10: and what was t hat?
Terry_VB: all of the past hour +
Terry_VB: all of the things I have told you.  Your 
        passion/convictions... all the fire you have inside
Terry_VB: and the kindness
Terry_VB: you have such a big heart
Terry_VB: but you hide behind your armor a lot 
berber10: shhhhhhhh...don't tell everyone
berber10: ;-)
Terry_VB: they don't need to know 
berber10: exactly
Terry_VB: you are gonna be a great leader one day
Terry_VB: isn't that what you desire?
Terry_VB: uh oh, where'd you go?
berber10: uh, no...not really
Terry_VB: ah, well let me rephrase that.  You have the 
        potential to be a great leader
berber10: I want to work overseas for a couple of 
        years...and then go to law school after that
Terry_VB: that's cool.  
berber10: but then I might just want to be a gigolo 
        down in South Beach
berber10: NOT
Terry_VB: you could make a lot of $$
Terry_VB: but you integrity would get in the way
Terry_VB: your
berber10: besides I don't think I could do that
Terry_VB: me, either
Terry_VB: I have given it away too long to start 
        charging now
berber10: LOL!!!!!    integrity aside...the thought of 
        endless sex partners does not exactly appeal to 
        me
Terry_VB: and it doesn't for most people
Terry_VB: that's why you're not a gigalo
Terry_VB: but there are countless people who have an
        insatiable appetite for sex
Terry_VB: I think Gay.com has like 3 million members 
        now
berber10: everybody is sleeping with everybody
Terry_VB: in a way
berber10: what kills me are these guys on here that 
        advertise for bareback
Terry_VB: well, it takes all kinds to make the world go 
        round
Terry_VB: I try not to judge people's behaviors, at least
        not for them... I just know what works for me
berber10: that's like going out and standing on the 
        middle of I-64 or Va Beach Blvd....hmmmm, 
        maybe I'll get hit, maybe I won't
Terry_VB: pretty much
Terry_VB: most likely you'll get hit
berber10: why would you knowingly take risks with 
        your health
Terry_VB: why would someone jump out of a perfectly 
        good airplane?
berber10: yeah, but they have a form of 
        protection....someone fucking with out a condom 
        is like jumping without a parachute
Terry_VB: I would venture to guess that it has to do 
        with a low self esteem and image
Terry_VB: yup.  when you play with fire, you get burned
Terry_VB: brb. gotta pee again
berber10: ok
Terry_VB: back
Terry_VB: whew!   I feel better
berber10: cool
berber10: glad to hear
Terry_VB: :-)
berber10: ? for you
Terry_VB: ok
berber10: would you want to have safe sex with 
        someone that told you they 
        occasionally/frequently engage in unprotected 
        sex?
Terry_VB: probably not
Terry_VB: am I dating this person?
berber10: u tell me
Terry_VB: If I really liked the person, I guess I would.  It
        would depend entirely on the situation, I guess
Terry_VB: I certainly wouldn't want an open 
        relationship
Terry_VB: that's asking for trouble
berber10: yeah, it's like why bother having a 
        relationship
Terry_VB: well I'm just too jealous to put myself in that 
        situation
Terry_VB: when I give my heart, it's all or nothing
berber10: That's a song by Cher..."All or Nothing"
berber10: I love that song
Terry_VB: it sure is
Terry_VB: :-)
Terry_VB: I love it, too
Terry_VB: I'm listening to it now
Terry_VB: now i want to dance
berber10: I was listening to it 4 CDs ago...now I am 
        listening to Janet
berber10: I also love "strong enough"
Terry_VB: yup.  I love Cher.  Her music is so universal
berber10: Are you playing the BELIEVE CD , or a 
        greatest hits compilation?
Terry_VB: MP3 player
berber10: cool
Terry_VB: that's how I found it so fast
berber10: baby, it's all or nothin'...baby, it's all or 
        nothin'....nnNNNOOOOOOWWWWWWW
Terry_VB: listening to strong enough now
Terry_VB: there's no more to say, so save your breath 
        and walk away
Terry_VB: no matter what I hear ya say.  I'm strong 
        enough to know you gotta go
berber10: I don't need you sympathies ....nothing you 
        can do or say or to say to me
berber10: God, are we gay or what?!
Terry_VB: lol
Terry_VB: Yes, we are!
berber10: and that's a *GOOD* thing...as that jailbird 
        Martha would say
Terry_VB: lol, right
Terry_VB: there aren't a whole lot of things I claim in 
        the gay world, but being a Cher fan is one of them
berber10: yeah...me, too...I was not a big fan until I 
        saw her in concert in DC 2 years go...I was so 
        blown away I went to 4 other shows
Terry_VB: in her 3 year goodbye tour?
berber10: and morphed into a big 'ol Cher queen
Terry_VB: lol
Terry_VB: well, I still like you
berber10: ;-)
Terry_VB: my new favorite song is by Maroon 5... she 
        will be loved
Terry_VB: dunno why, but it just makes me happy
Terry_VB: are you always a night owl, or just when 
        you're home in Yorktown?
berber10: I love TOXIC
berber10: no, I am not normally up this late
Terry_VB: but it's not everyday you meet me
berber10: true
berber10: ;-)
Terry_VB: you like Toxic by Britney?
berber10: and a Cher queen on top of all of the other 
        stuff
Terry_VB: lol
berber10: LOL
berber10: yeah
Terry_VB: it doesn't really move me
Terry_VB: but I like it
berber10: I still listen to "Dirrty" by Christina A
berber10: I love that song
berber10: that whole CD is awesome
Terry_VB: yeah, I like Christina Aguilera
Terry_VB: yup.  we're pretty gay
berber10: I was supposed to see her in Philly back in 
        June, but she canceled her summer tour due to 
        throat problems
Terry_VB: ahhh
berber10: and I was supposed to see Britney in July, 
        but she canceled the rest of her tour when she 
        blew out her knee
berber10: what was a fag to do?!?!?!?
Terry_VB:  too much time spent on her knees
berber10: Go see Madonna
berber10: twice!
Terry_VB: lol, of course
berber10: i had to get my diva fix in some how
Terry_VB: you gotta do what you gotta do
Terry_VB: I totally understand
berber10: oh, yeah, I saw Annie Lennox this summer 
        too
Terry_VB: my friend saw her in Pittsburgh.  he said 
        she was awesome
berber10: LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE her
Terry_VB: the best live performance he's seen in a 
        long time
Terry_VB: yeah, her song Into the West was such an 
        important song for me this year
berber10: the one song that really kind of moved me 
        was a song off of Maddy's last CD- "nothing fails"
berber10: the arrangements were sparse, but it had a
        lush chorus
berber10: and it was a poignant song
Terry_VB: I don't guess I've heard that one
berber10: it wasn't released commercially as a single
Terry_VB: ah, well that would be why I haven't heard it
berber10: do u like Madonna?
Terry_VB: I do.  I am just not as passionate about her 
        music as most gay men are
Terry_VB: She's a great artist... I just don't care for her 
        as a person
berber10: how do u see her as a person?
Terry_VB: she's very self centered
Terry_VB: she said it best when she was on Oprah.  
        She always asks "what's in it for me?" before she
        does anything
berber10: yeah, she's a bitch, I agree
berber10: BUt I still love her
berber10: hehehehe
Terry_VB: *nods*  so Madonna can be a bitch but your
        sister can't?
Terry_VB: ;-)

        knows the power behind the throne is where the
