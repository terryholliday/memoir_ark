        Navy a few yrs ago and thniking about 
        visiting next month on my way to De 
Terry_VB: ah ok
stjoe22: thnking I may spend the night in VA 
        and go to the bars 
Terry_VB: lol, but why?
stjoe22: I miss the wave and pi's and the 
        Garage 
Terry_VB: there's no more PI's
stjoe22: stillknow a couple fo guys in the area 
        nad
Terry_VB: the Wave and Garage are still there, 
        though
stjoe22: and have noty seen any of them in 
        about 2 -3 now 
stjoe22: I figured PI's would close eventully 
stjoe22: the wave is a blkast 
stjoe22: I was there when they first opend up 
stjoe22: I can still remember a few nights of 
        drinking and then dancing in thecage 
stjoe22: okay that was almost everytime I was 
        there 
stjoe22: lol
Terry_VB: unh huh
Terry_VB: I haven't been to the Wave in a few 
        years
stjoe22: see I don't get too many bars here in 
        KC becauseof the job I have to go out of 
        town to have a good time 
stjoe22: last time I was at the wave it was like 
        a kbig gay reunion 
stjoe22: the gang I use to hang out with was at
        the bar 
stjoe22: including a ex bf 
Terry_VB: that's because they probably go 
        every weekend, and have since you left
stjoe22: I love seeign old bf's after a few yrs 
stjoe22: they look older and a bit more 
        weathered and I look oh well the same 
stjoe22: lol
Terry_VB: good genetics
stjoe22: yeah you know I owe my dad 
        something 
Terry_VB: oh, you got that part from him, too?
Terry_VB: no wonder your bf calls you a brick
stjoe22: lol
stjoe22: no alot of it has to do withthe fact that 
        when I was in the Navy I was a bit easy or 
        a playa as they say now 
stjoe22: lol
stjoe22: was in my wild care  free days 
stjoe22: lool
Terry_VB: ah, the good ol days
stjoe22:  yeah 
stjoe22: I miss being a slut
stjoe22: lol
Terry_VB: naw, you are one of the lucky ones
stjoe22: I know very lucky 
stjoe22: now I try to help others that are not as 
        lucky as I am or odo not have the 
        education to help them along the way 
Terry_VB: that's what we're supposed to do
Terry_VB: give back
stjoe22: after the navy I got involed with 
        HIV/AIDS service and now I am the 
        program coordinator of gay 
        programmingin my agency 
stjoe22: I do testing and counseling for HIV 
Terry_VB: what made you get involved with 
        that?
stjoe22: had a friend that worked there that got
        me a foot in the door 
stjoe22: but I wanted to do this because there 
        are too many guys my age getting infected
        still 
stjoe22: and it should not be happening 
Terry_VB: why do you think it happens?
stjoe22: thery don't have the education to help 
        them out 
stjoe22: and they are not aware of how too get 
        the virus 
stjoe22: most don't know the 4 fludis that 
        transmit the virus
Terry_VB: ok, I will give you that for some.  
        Lack of awareness is definitely a cause, 
        but what about those who do know the 
        risks?
stjoe22: well that is wheree you get intothe 
        area of drug useage 
stjoe22: meth and coke fuck withthe receptiors
        in the brains effecting judgement 
stjoe22: and things are not always what they 
        seem 
stjoe22: a condom to to me is a life saver 
Terry_VB: as it should be to everyone
stjoe22: I am living proof that when you do use
        a condom you don;t get AIDS 
Terry_VB: and I am living proof that when you 
        don't, you do
stjoe22: I was in a 7 month relationship  witha 
        guy from Norfolk who was postive and we 
        had sex 
stjoe22: so you arer HIV pos?
Terry_VB: yeah
stjoe22: cool 
stjoe22: well ot really 
Terry_VB: I know what you mean
stjoe22: but you know what I mean I hope 
stjoe22: cool 
stjoe22: are you very open about your status 
Terry_VB: not really.  I tell the people who need
        to know
stjoe22: cool 
stjoe22: at least you are doignthat 
stjoe22: some of the pos guys don't and that 
        really worries me 
stjoe22: I am goignto be doing ore work this yr 
        withthe pos community 
stjoe22: that is where I think we need to shift a 
        major majority of or efforts 
stjoe22: if the pos community that knows 
        discloses the rate will drop 
stjoe22: and then we can foucs more on guys 
        who have not been tersted so that they 
        know their status 
stjoe22: how long have you been pos 
Terry_VB: since 6/13/03... Friday the 13th
stjoe22: is that the daythey told you or the date 
        that you think you had the most exposiure 
        to it 
Terry_VB: no, that's the day I was diagnosed.  I
        contracted it on March 7, 2003
stjoe22: okay 
stjoe22: alot of guys still don;t know when they 
        were expossed to it 
stjoe22: I think that is a huge part of it 
Terry_VB: not when you are
stjoe22: but if I had been infectedn when I was
        int he navy I would  have had no clue 
stjoe22: I may have been able to track it down 
        to the about time but finding the one who 
        that could have been hard at times 
stjoe22: I don;t know why I am not pois to this 
        day 
Terry_VB: you weren't meant to be
stjoe22: I took alot of risks through out the 
        years 
Terry_VB: as many have
stjoe22: but hell really when I look back at my 
        past I don't know how 
stjoe22: I still get tested and don't know why I 
        am oneof the lucky of 
Terry_VB: because it was not meant to be
Terry_VB: I totally believe I have chosen this 
        path for a reason, even though I don't 
        know all of them now
stjoe22: but I use my stories adn escapades 
        to help educate 
stjoe22: I know manybe I was one of the ones 
        who is suppossed to be doing what I am 
        doing now 
stjoe22: if so then I guess I am doing good 
stjoe22: =-)
Terry_VB: yeah, you're on track, my friend
stjoe22: I hope so 
Terry_VB: when is your birthday?
stjoe22: Dec 20th why 
Terry_VB: b/c I study Astrology.  I was just 
        curious
stjoe22: I know I am the youngest guy in MO or
        KS that is workign this hard in the field 
stjoe22: cool

Terry_VB: yup
Terry_VB: that's cool that you know that

        Community Planning Groups 
Terry_VB: no, that you know your zodiac sign
stjoe22: state rep for each 
stjoe22: run a gay youth group 
Terry_VB: but it's awesome that you are an 
        activist
stjoe22: wrok witha group for women of color 
        at risk 
Terry_VB: they are probably one of the higest 
        risk groups because of men on the DL
stjoe22: work for the Kansas City Eligible 
        Metro Area Ryan White Council 
stjoe22: work with 3 advocacy groupos here in 
        town and that is on top of my regular job 
stjoe22: I work all the time 
stjoe22: had a cookout  today at the park 
stjoe22: with the guys from my group and their 
        families 
stjoe22: Gen Q family and friends cookout m
stjoe22: second yr we have don it 
Terry_VB: I haven't involved myself with any of 
        the area activism efforts here
stjoe22: why not 
Terry_VB: apathy
stjoe22: I am sure the Community Planning 
        Group coulld use your help 
Terry_VB: I am sure they could
stjoe22: you have alot of informsation that 
        would be godo to share and brinrg to the 
        table 
Terry_VB: yeah, well I guess that's why I met 
        you tonight
stjoe22: help decided hoiw the state health 
        dept allocates prevention monies in your 
        state 
stjoe22: help come up withthe plan for the 
        state for the yr 
Terry_VB: yeah, I just missed that meeting for 
        the Ryan White Council
stjoe22: work with Mitch's groupm there in 
        town and talk to the young guys about 
        dealing with being positive 
stjoe22: go to the next one for RW
stjoe22: the younger generation dose not see 
        that this age range is getting infected 
Terry_VB: brb
stjoe22: they think they are safebnand need to 
        know other wise 
stjoe22: I know that outing is a hrd thing to do 
stjoe22: but if you are ever ready to do that it is 
        somethingt hat we in the field need 
Terry_VB: sorry, I'm back. -- I would be foolish 
        to sit here and tell you that I didn't believe 
        in my heart of hearts that my path is 
        headed in much the same direction as 
        yours... because 3 years ago, way before I
        even thought about myself having HIV, I 
        had started working on fund raising efforts
        in the area.  They just got put on the back 
        burner b/c my life was in a whirlwind at the
        time.  Eventually I know that I will use my 
        pain to help others, but before I can help 
        heal anyone else, I have to find the 
        healing in myself.
Terry_VB: and that, I've been working on for the
        last year
stjoe22: it'll take some time 
stjoe22: but it dose get easier 
Terry_VB: as does any great challenge
stjoe22: I know that if I were to become 
        positive even dealing with it from work 
        everyday 
stjoe22: it would be a while before I outed 
        myself to every oen I know 
Terry_VB: I didn't have that luxury
Terry_VB: but I have controlled it somewhat
Terry_VB: I still haven't told any of my 
        immediate family.  
stjoe22: wow 
stjoe22: btw my name is TY 
Terry_VB: I know.  I read your "Scene"
Terry_VB: ;-)
stjoe22: sweetie you should tell them 
stjoe22: I know that has to be hard 
stjoe22: what's holding you back for it?
stjoe22: do yo mind me asking 
Terry_VB: Not at all.  
stjoe22: if I get tooo personal just let me know 
Terry_VB: you can't
stjoe22: okay cool 
Terry_VB: If you ask me a question, I'll answer 
        it honestly
stjoe22: same here I am a very open book 
stjoe22: lol
stjoe22: so what's holdoing you back from 
        tellingt he family
Terry_VB: I am not close to my family that way. 
        Our level of connection is very much 
        superficial.  
Terry_VB: My mom is a fundamental christian 
        and would blame herself
stjoe22: ok ic 
Terry_VB: my dad wouldn't even begin to 
        understand
Terry_VB: and my brother and sister dont' 
        need to know.  I don't live near them and 
        they dont' share in most of my life
Terry_VB: but the people that matter in my life 
        do know
Terry_VB: in my everyday life, I mean
Terry_VB: "coming out" as HIV+ is much the 
        same process as "coming out" gay
Terry_VB: and I saw what that did to my 
        relationship to my mom
Terry_VB: so that's why  :-)
Terry_VB: did I lose ya?
stjoe22: just got back to the room 
stjoe22: my pc frooze 
Terry_VB: ah
stjoe22: I am on my lap top and it can only take
        so much before it locks up 
stjoe22: was look you your name on the last 
stjoe22: lol
stjoe22: but ya I am close with my family 
stjoe22: goign to moms tommrow an hour 
        drive to oe the yard and have lunch

stjoe22: it dose not seem like 2 months ago 
        iwas getting ready for pride to end 
stjoe22: lol
Terry_VB: yeah, time flies 
Terry_VB: and the older we get, the faster it 
        flies
stjoe22: I know it's just not right 
Terry_VB: time is just an illusion anyway
Terry_VB: but that's a WHOLE other topic
stjoe22: lol
Terry_VB: I peeked at your chart..   You have a 
        lot of fire
stjoe22: and that means?
stjoe22: lol
stjoe22: I know it has to do with ast. but not 
        sure wht 
stjoe22: =-)
Terry_VB: well, Sagittarius is a fire sign.  Fire 
        signs are always on the go, inspirational 
        to others... 
stjoe22: oh hell yeah I am never end 
Terry_VB: but your moon sign is Taurus... so 
        your emotions are even-keeled
Terry_VB: keeps you focused
Terry_VB: and driven
Terry_VB: patience and persistence
stjoe22: like that fucln bunny withthe drum and
        batterrieds and the cute ass
stjoe22: lol
Terry_VB: do you know what time you were 
        born?
stjoe22: 130
stjoe22: pm 
Terry_VB: cool.  I was born at 1:24 p.m.   I feel 
        stupid for asking this (because it's 4:20 
        a.m.) but are you a nite owl normally?
Terry_VB: well, 4:20 my time
stjoe22: yeah 
stjoe22: wow 420 hold on a sec I am goingto 
        to celebrate for you 
Terry_VB: lol
stjoe22: hey you said what time it wasor were 
        you tring to see what type of guy I really 
        was 
stjoe22: lol
stjoe22: yes I am a pot head 
stjoe22: I ahve to admit that 
stjoe22: not in the profile 
stjoe22: one of the things I left out because of 
        the rep withthe  job and all 
Terry_VB: actually it was only 4:17.  That was 
        my way of finding out if you were
Terry_VB: ;-)
Terry_VB: but it is 4:20 now!
stjoe22: okay here I go 
stjoe22: lo
Terry_VB: what city were you born in?
Terry_VB: I already hit the bong.  Hell!  I've 
        been stoned our entire conversation 
        actually
stjoe22: Worcester MA 
stjoe22: cool so have I 
stjoe22: I have been smoking out mf my new 
        pip 
Terry_VB: sweet
stjoe22: it is so cool
stjoe22: it's the resin typoe 
Terry_VB: *shrugs*  
stjoe22: by the stem is a tree branch with a 
        stoned money 
Terry_VB: cool, listen to this... 
Terry_VB: Your astrological combination 
        suggests worldly success. Your 
        determination and reserve temper the 
        Sagittarian impulsiveness, and your 
        foresight can be used for practical ends. 
Terry_VB: With your warmth and geniality, you 
        usually find fulfillment in personal 
        relationships. In love you are patient until 
        you have made your conquest. Your pace 
        is slow and determined. You have a 
        reservoir of knowledge that can be 
        practically applied.
Terry_VB: It is likely that you would be a faithful 
        and devoted friend, and that your 
        conscientious attitude could be relied 
        upon. 
stjoe22: true 
stjoe22: but all of that can also be bad 
stjoe22: one of the things 
Terry_VB: there is always a yang to the yin
stjoe22: careing and compassionate friend 
stjoe22: can tend to lead to intimacy with 
        friends 
stjoe22: lol
stjoe22: damn the luck 
stjoe22: I know 
stjoe22: cute and compassionate all in one 
Terry_VB: what a curse
stjoe22: what could be more fun
stjoe22: I know 
stjoe22: a barrel full of monkeys 
Terry_VB: what's your email address?  I'll send
        you this mini report
stjoe22: okay don't laugh at the name 
Terry_VB: I can't make that promise
stjoe22: I go it from my lesbien navy mama 
        after I came out to her
stjoe22: prettyboy4u2_1999@yahoo.com
Terry_VB: well you are a pretty boy
stjoe22: she asked me if I was a prettyboy and
        I looked at her stupidly and she asked 
        againa nd said if you are you know what a 
        prettyboy is and if not then your have no 
        clue what I am talking about
stjoe22: I told her that her and I  now spoke a a
        new special language 
stjoe22: lol
stjoe22: I miss her 
Terry_VB: awww
stjoe22: did you go out alot when you were like
        21 in the area?
Terry_VB: more than I do now
stjoe22: where all did you go?
Terry_VB: well, Private Eyes was the first gay 
        club I had ever gone to... but it closed 
        down not long after I moved here, so I 
        went to the Wave
Terry_VB: sometimes I would get dragged to 
        the Garage
Terry_VB: I live right across the street from the 
        Rainbow Cactus 
stjoe22: how long have you lived in VB?
stjoe22: and have you always lived across 
        from RC?
Terry_VB: since 1997

        the bar and gave the counrty western side 
        theoir own adn started the dance dance
