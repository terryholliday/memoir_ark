        it opens up when they stand in front of it
Terry_VB: I had an automatic door installed 
        years ago
Terry_VB: much easier
JamieJ1: easier....or lazier????*L*
Terry_VB: aren't they the same?
JamieJ1: i think they are.....they're the reason 
        for remote controls*L*
Terry_VB: lol, and all the other conveniences 
        we now have
JamieJ1: exactly.....but, how i do love them
Terry_VB: me, too
JamieJ1: hell, it's a bit chilly in here but i'm too 
        lazy tonight to turn the a/c off
Terry_VB: it feels nice in here
JamieJ1: lucky
Terry_VB: it's 72
JamieJ1: i don't know the temp in here...all i 
        know is it's chilly
Terry_VB: well put some clothes on
JamieJ1: i have to get up to do that...
Terry_VB: or you could sit here and talk about it
        and not fix it
JamieJ1: lol.....hang on...i'm gonna go turn the 
        a'c off instead of putting more clothes on
Terry_VB: ok
JamieJ1: there we go...that's should do it
JamieJ1: if it doesn't then i'll put more clothes 
        on
Terry_VB: good deal
JamieJ1: actually, i think i might go to bed 
        soon...i didn't sleep very well last night
Terry_VB: well don't let me keep you
JamieJ1: oh....it's alright....i can hang on for a 
        few more minutes
Terry_VB: yeah, but then I won't talk much b/c 
        I'll feel like I'm keeping you awake
JamieJ1: i tell you what....10 more 
        minutes...then i'm going to bed
Terry_VB: ok
JamieJ1: i gotta work on the whole stamina 
        thing*L*
Terry_VB: I'll bet you've got stamina
JamieJ1: i do....when i need it
Terry_VB: unh huh
JamieJ1: but, it's just good to push it every 
        now and then
Terry_VB: I am all about pushing limits
JamieJ1: i bet you are
Terry_VB: pushin and pushin
Terry_VB: mmmmmm
JamieJ1: lol
JamieJ1: as long as you don't puch too hard
JamieJ1: push*
Terry_VB: naw
JamieJ1: so, been on any good dates lately?
Terry_VB: not really... I've been spending my 
        time with my friends
JamieJ1: nothing wrong with that
Terry_VB: nope, I don't think so
Terry_VB: what about you?  Any hot dates?
JamieJ1: nope...jsut rosie and her 5 sisters
Terry_VB: well, as long as you're content
JamieJ1: well, i guess it's good for now
Terry_VB: is it?
JamieJ1: it's good enough i guess
Terry_VB: how do you resist all the people who
        are attracted to you?
JamieJ1: well, as nice as that 
        sounds....there's not a lot of people 
        attracted to me
Terry_VB: maybe you just aren't paying 
        attention?
JamieJ1: well, .....that may be ...i dunno
Terry_VB: I am too wise to believe that 
        someone who has the personality that 
        you do and the good looks that you do 
        could not attract others to you
JamieJ1: honestly....i'm just not trying right 
        now
JamieJ1: i've gone out and talk to people....but 
        that's it right now
Terry_VB: then that's well and good as long as
        you are getting what you want
JamieJ1: i just have a few things to work out 
        before i get into the whole dating scene 
        again
Terry_VB: I understand
JamieJ1: and on that note....it's 5 minutes past
        bedtime
Terry_VB: yup
Terry_VB: have a good night

        stay up too late
