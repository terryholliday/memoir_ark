JamieJ1: hey there
Terry_VB: hey you
JamieJ1: what areyou up to?
Terry_VB: on the phone cancelling my AOL 
        free trial
JamieJ1: gotcha
Terry_VB: what are you up to?
JamieJ1: not much...just thinking about going 
        to bed
Terry_VB: tired?
JamieJ1: a little
Terry_VB: yeah me too
Terry_VB: you worked today?
JamieJ1: no....i was off....sorked around the 
        house though
Terry_VB: get anything done?
JamieJ1: yeah...got the kitchen done..and 
        some laundry
JamieJ1: i really took the day to relax
JamieJ1: how was your night out?
Terry_VB: eh, there weren't many hot guys out
Terry_VB: we got pretty trashed
JamieJ1: nothing wrong with gettin trashed 
        every now and then
Terry_VB: I wasn't planning to drink, but when 
        someone else is buying me drinks, I have
        a hard time turning them down
JamieJ1: who was buying you drinks?
Terry_VB: Mike
JamieJ1: nothing wrong with that eiether*L*
Terry_VB: naw, he doesn't usually get that 
        trashed... he usually drinks beer
Terry_VB: he spent a good hour making love to
        my toilet when we got home
Terry_VB: I was fine.   well, I wasn't fine, I was 
        DRUNK
Terry_VB: but I didn't get sick
Terry_VB: thank God
JamieJ1: lol....we've all been there
Terry_VB: I knew if I got him drunk enough, I 
        could get him in my bed
Terry_VB: mouahaha
JamieJ1: lol.....that's it...always have a plan
Terry_VB: naw, I just joke.  I gave up on him 
        back in March
JamieJ1: well, it certainly does sound like you 
        had a good time
Terry_VB: yeah, and I'm sure it'll be a while 
        before I go out again
JamieJ1: i try not to get messed up very much 
        either...usually only once a month
Terry_VB: I go through moods
Terry_VB: I went 8 months without drinking 
        anything
JamieJ1: well, you just do it when you feel like 
        it
Terry_VB: yup
Terry_VB: so did you take any pictures for me? 
        ;-)   
JamieJ1: uh-oh...i totally forgot......
Terry_VB: it's ok.
JamieJ1: i'm sorry about that..
Terry_VB: it's not a problem.  I've waited 4 
        years to see your eyes.  What's another 
        week or two?
JamieJ1: exactly.....it just takes a while*L*
Terry_VB: lucky for you, I've become a much 
        more patient person
JamieJ1: *L*...oh yeah....i'm relieved
Terry_VB: no, because you also know I'm 
        persistent about getting what I want, and 
        you know I'll keep asking until you finally 
        do
JamieJ1: yeah.....i'll cave in..i know
Terry_VB: or disappear
JamieJ1: ouch.....easy now*L*
Terry_VB: sorry, after I said that, I realized it 
        was a little too harsh
Terry_VB: honest, but harsh
JamieJ1: that's okay.....
Terry_VB: naw, you are nothing but nice to me
JamieJ1: yeah...so take it easy on me ;-)
Terry_VB: hrmm, my wheels are churning
JamieJ1: lol
JamieJ1: i did some reading up over the past 
        couple of days
Terry_VB: oh yeah?  what did you learn?
JamieJ1: quite a bit...but doing some more 
        reading
Terry_VB: Geminis and your facts
JamieJ1: yeah...we love knowledge
Terry_VB: I know.  Virgos love knowledge, too.  
        We are just more discriminating with the 
        information we find
Terry_VB: it's a Mercury trait... and both Gemini 
        and Virgo are ruled by Mercury
JamieJ1: i figure you can never know too much
Terry_VB: I thirst for knowledge... random 
        facts... whatever
Terry_VB: I get a e-newsletter called 
        Knowledge News.  They send emails 
        about random things in the news... It's 
        always interesting to me
JamieJ1: i read these books calle "the 
        bathroom reader"...they're full of facts and 
        things
Terry_VB: so tell me what you learned about 
        HIV that you didn't already know that took 
        you by surprise?
JamieJ1: i didn't realize how far spread it's 
        spread
Terry_VB: and by the way, this Orbit gum is not 
        better than my Extra Polar Ice
JamieJ1: i also heard that it could be 
        contracted through the mouth if you have 
        an open sore or a cut 
JamieJ1: ...and yes it is*L*
Terry_VB: any kind of open sore or cut or 
        infected hair... there are a lot of ways
JamieJ1: yeah....i read it's still a possibility but 
        it's very very very rare....i read that saliva 
        has natural disease fighting agents 
Terry_VB: *nods*  they say there have been no 
        reported cases where someone who only 
        had oral sex had ever transmitted it.  
Terry_VB: or contracted it, I mean
JamieJ1: yeah...that's what i read....i never 
        knew that
Terry_VB: yup.  You should check out the 
        resources on Gay.com if you haven't 
        already.  There are a lot of good stories, 
        etc. that were helpful to me
JamieJ1: i did....i read pretty much all of it
JamieJ1: just reading up on what was safe 
        and what had higher risks
Terry_VB: well, any kind of anal sex has a risk, 
        even with a condom.  Topping with a 
        condom has the least risk of any 
        intercourse.  Kissing is ok except if 
        someone has a cold sore
JamieJ1: have you topped since you found 
        out?
Terry_VB: yeah
JamieJ1: and he knew you were positive
Terry_VB: yeah
Terry_VB: he is, too
JamieJ1: ah...i see
Terry_VB: but even two HIV+ people aren't free.
        There are different strands, other things.  
Terry_VB: but all of those things are just 
        physical symptoms of a much bigger 
        issue at hand
JamieJ1: yeah....i knew that....i guess the first 
        time you had sex after you found out had 
        to be a nervous time
Terry_VB: well, I had to have a time to feel 
        "sorry" for myself, and for awhile I was 
        going to never have sex again until I was 
        in a relationship
JamieJ1: iremember you saying that
Terry_VB: when?
JamieJ1: you said it the other night
Terry_VB: I did?
Terry_VB: ok
JamieJ1: gee...at least one of us was paying 
        attention*L*
Terry_VB: oh I was there
JamieJ1: i know....i'm just teasin ya
Terry_VB: and I even reread the chat log after 
        you went to bed
Terry_VB: that's why I'm surprised I don't 
        remember
JamieJ1: yeah...you told me that
Terry_VB: but anyway
Terry_VB: it didn't last
JamieJ1: and that's a good thing
Terry_VB: no, because I keep getting what I 
        don't want
JamieJ1: but, you're not a slave to yourself
Terry_VB: no, but I'm a recovering sexual 
        addict
JamieJ1: well, we're all something
Terry_VB: yeah, I suppose we are
Terry_VB: speaking of which, would it be so 
        terrible to ask if we could have another 
        means of talking (like AIM, yahoo, MSN) 
        anything other than gay.com
JamieJ1: yeah....i'm back on yahoo
JamieJ1: shadowj616
Terry_VB: fitting
Terry_VB: ok, I added you
JamieJ1: and i just sent you a message
Terry_VB: yup
Terry_VB: I got it
Terry_VB: did you get mine back?
JamieJ1: i did
JamieJ1: ie said..."yup"
JamieJ1: it*
Terry_VB: yup
Terry_VB: :-)
Terry_VB: what are you doing?
JamieJ1: sorry....i had to pee
Terry_VB: no worries
Terry_VB: ok, we hit a dead spot
JamieJ1: yes we did....what happened???
Terry_VB: I dunno.  We do that a lot
JamieJ1: it's amazing how that happens
Terry_VB: not amazing.  I guess even the best 
        of us can have breaks in conversations
Terry_VB: it was like we were on the same 
        channel and then we both flipped to 
        another
JamieJ1: yeah....conversation channel surfing
Terry_VB: lol, right
Terry_VB: it's all good, though.  Are you ready 
        for bed?
JamieJ1: bot...if i had a nickel for everytie i 
        heard that.....
JamieJ1: ..i could make change for a dime*L*
Terry_VB: lol
Terry_VB: now you're just giddy
JamieJ1: i'll be going to bed soon enough
Terry_VB: ok.  I'm not rushing you.  Believe me,
        you have ended 99% of our conversations
        in the past.  
JamieJ1: i know...i very aware of that
JamieJ1: i stay up as long as i can though
Terry_VB: me, too
Terry_VB: and when it's with you, it's not that 
        hard to do
JamieJ1: awww.....don't make me blush 
        now*L*
Terry_VB: I'm just being honest with you
JamieJ1: well, thank you
Terry_VB: though telling you how you make me
        feel shouldn't need to be said, I always 
        love saying it.
JamieJ1: that's quite alright
Terry_VB: yeah, you would be blood red
Terry_VB: you blush too easily
JamieJ1: i do....and i don't tan...i just burn
Terry_VB: you're sensitive
JamieJ1: that could be it.....i just think it's in the
        genes....
Terry_VB: well of course it is.  You don't think a 
        sensitive person like yourself would be 
        born from people who weren't, do you?
JamieJ1: if i get a good burn i'll end up 
        tanning...but it hurts like hell
Terry_VB: and it should hurt.  You're damaging
        your body
JamieJ1: exactly...that's shy i don't stay tan...i 
        don't want skin cancer
Terry_VB: dude, you're talking to powder here
JamieJ1: lol.....you're not that bad
Terry_VB: some guy online the other day told 
        me that my pasty white skin was causing 
        his eyes to hurt
JamieJ1: damn...that's a little harsh*L*
Terry_VB: yeah, I thought so, too
Terry_VB: but I didn't care.  I don't want a 
        suntan or I would have one
JamieJ1: exactly...but i am getting tired of 
        putting my sunglasses on when i show 
        my bare ass*L*
Terry_VB: I guess my eyes have just adjusted 
        to mine
Terry_VB: I try to keep the lights dim, though
JamieJ1: i'll have to try that trick
Terry_VB: it's amazing what you can do with 
        lighting
JamieJ1: well.....i think it's about that time....
Terry_VB: okie doke
Terry_VB: oh!
JamieJ1: oh?
Terry_VB: You were in my dreams BIG TIME I 
        guess Sunday morning it was
JamieJ1: oh really?
Terry_VB: yeah, and they were vivid at the time
Terry_VB: though I can't remember them now
JamieJ1: you don't remember any of it?
Terry_VB: not right now.  :-(   I just remember I 
        kept waking up from dreams of you
JamieJ1: was i clothed in these dreams?
Terry_VB: yeah, they weren't sexual
Terry_VB: I don't think.  I don't remember them 
        now
JamieJ1: you need to remember them and tell 
        me
Terry_VB: I doubt very seriously that they were
JamieJ1: well, if you remember any of them let
        me know
Terry_VB: oh, don't worry.  I will
JamieJ1: okie doke...
JamieJ1: i'm gonna get my butt to bed....
Terry_VB: sweet dreams
Terry_VB: and have a good day today
JamieJ1: you too...talk to you later
Terry_VB: g'nite
