Terry_VB: Hey Jamie
Terry_VB: how are you?
JamieJ1: pretty good...and how are you?
Terry_VB: pretty tired.  we were slammed tonight
Terry_VB: and I was hung over all day from 2 drinks 
        last night
JamieJ1: you worked tonight?
Terry_VB: yeah
Terry_VB: I made good $$ though, so I guess it was 
        worth it
JamieJ1: well, nothing wrong with that
Terry_VB: nope
Terry_VB: how was your 4th of July?
JamieJ1: busy.....it's always bust around holidays
JamieJ1: busy*
Terry_VB: did yo have to work yesterday?
JamieJ1: i did
Terry_VB: I spent the afternoon/evening at my cousin 
        Jackie's in Chesapeake
JamieJ1: you didn't go see any fireworks?
Terry_VB: naw... but I went to the Rainbow Cactus 
        with my friend Mike and Trina
JamieJ1: did you have fun there?
Terry_VB: yeah, I met two really cool guys, Mike and 
        Andrew.  They were both from out of town
JamieJ1: very good....
Terry_VB: but had I known I was going to wake up at 
        10 am and throw my guts up I wouldn't have had 
        the two drinks I did
JamieJ1: lol......from just 2 drinks?
Terry_VB: yeah, my body just doesn't tolerate liquor 
        anymore
JamieJ1: i guess not
Terry_VB: so it will probably be a LONG time before I 
        try that again
JamieJ1: well, just make sure when you do that it's a 
        good occasion
Terry_VB: weLl, this was the first time I had even 
        gone out to a gay bar in 8 months
JamieJ1: sounds to me like it may be another 8 
        months before you go back
Terry_VB: most likely
JamieJ1: hey...i'll brb
Terry_VB: ok
JamieJ1: okie doke.....i'm back
Terry_VB: I'm still here
Terry_VB: so what time are you going to bed tonight?
JamieJ1: i dunno......i need to wake up early but i'm 
        not the least bit tired now....
Terry_VB: what time do you have to be up?
JamieJ1: around 9:30
Terry_VB: yuck
JamieJ1: yeah.....but it's all good
Terry_VB: I need to start getting myself used to going 
        to bed early
JamieJ1: yeah, you start school soon don't you?
Terry_VB: end of this month
JamieJ1: congratulations
Terry_VB: :-)  yay
JamieJ1: you go boy!!!
Terry_VB: I'm not feeling the excitement for it right 
        now
JamieJ1: too tired?
Terry_VB: *shrugs*   I don't think that's it... I guess I'm 
        just not looking forward to 80 hour weeks
JamieJ1: yeah, but it will all be worth it....
Terry_VB: no doubt
JamieJ1: you'll enjoy it
Terry_VB: I sure hope so.... I love learning anything
JamieJ1: i'm the same way...learning new things is 
        fun
Terry_VB: so what else is new?
JamieJ1: unfortunately nothing.....everything's the 
        same ole same ole
JamieJ1: isn't that sad????*L*
Terry_VB: not really, just means you don't pay 
        attention to the details in life
JamieJ1: uh-oh....am i gonna get lectured? ;-)
Terry_VB: not at all
JamieJ1: i'm just teasing you
Terry_VB: see, I didn't even catch that sarcasm
JamieJ1: well, you're still recovering from 2 drinks
Terry_VB: lol, right
JamieJ1: what were you drinking?
Terry_VB: some drink called an eye catcher.  I don't 
        know what it has in it... 
Terry_VB: it tastes good.  sweet and fruity
JamieJ1: did anyone catch your eye?
Terry_VB: I got my ass grabbed more times last night
        than I have ever going out
JamieJ1: uh-oh
Terry_VB: I know
Terry_VB: I was feelin sexy
Terry_VB: which wasn't how I felt when I went in
JamieJ1: lol.....you liked gettin grabbed....at least a 
        little
Terry_VB: of course I did
Terry_VB: was very flattering
JamieJ1: but you didn't go home with anyone
Terry_VB: well, Mike, Trina, Mike, and Andrew came 
        back to my place for awhile
Terry_VB: but then they all left
JamieJ1: still...it sounds like it was a good night
Terry_VB: overall, yeah
JamieJ1: good
Terry_VB: the one guy Andrew is a Virgo, too
Terry_VB: and he's into Astrology
Terry_VB: so we talked about that stuff for most of the
        night
JamieJ1: are you 2 gonna see each other again?
Terry_VB: he lives in Richmond
Terry_VB: and the other Mike is from Philly
JamieJ1: so i take that as a no
Terry_VB: i'd say that's a good bet
Terry_VB: but who the hell knows?  I didn't think I'd 
        see you again 
JamieJ1: well, i certainly apologize for taking so long 
        finding you 
Terry_VB: it's all good, but I definitely could've used 
        you last year
JamieJ1: and how might i have helped you?
Terry_VB: to stay optimistic
JamieJ1: i know no matter how do down you get 
        you'll always snap back
Terry_VB: apparently
JamieJ1: well, if i'm gonna wake up around 9:30 i 
        better try to get some sleep
Terry_VB: ok man
Terry_VB: sleep well
JamieJ1: alright....i'll talk to you later....and stay away 
        from those drinks*L*
Terry_VB: g'nite
JamieJ1: nite
