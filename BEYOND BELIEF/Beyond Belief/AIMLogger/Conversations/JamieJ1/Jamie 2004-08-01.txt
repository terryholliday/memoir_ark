Terry_VB: aw, come on... you kill me
JamieJ1: lol....well it's true
JamieJ1: you know me...
Terry_VB: yes, and that's why I know there's more than meets the eye
JamieJ1: lol..nope...
JamieJ1: i haven't seen you in a while...i was wondering how you've been
Terry_VB: energy level's been a little down this week
Terry_VB: but I'm good.  workin away
JamieJ1: well, i'm sorry to hear about the slow energy level...but at least you're still kickin
Terry_VB: That's what I say
JamieJ1: anything new on your end?
Terry_VB: I guess not.  We're pretty boring people
JamieJ1: yeah....i guess we are
Terry_VB: nah
Terry_VB: we're just not thinking
Terry_VB: there's lots to share
JamieJ1: hhmmmm....what shall we share then?
Terry_VB: tell me something about you that I don't know and would probably shock me if I knew
JamieJ1: wow.....let me think about that one for a minute
Terry_VB: ok
JamieJ1: i can't believe i'm this boring...i'm having a hard time here....
Terry_VB: you're not boring
Terry_VB: you are quite interesting
JamieJ1: i've told you a lot of the things that i shought were shocking....i'm drawing a 
        blank here....
Terry_VB: ok
JamieJ1: i'm sure there's some things but they're not poppin up ....
Terry_VB: you can't force it
JamieJ1: lol...boy, isn't that the truth
Terry_VB: is anything flowing?
JamieJ1: okay...i've got one....
JamieJ1: remember what i told you i do for a living
Terry_VB: yeah
JamieJ1: well, i haven't done that for about a year now...i have a new job
Terry_VB: what are you doing now?
JamieJ1: been doing it for about a year now
JamieJ1: beach police
Terry_VB: well yeah, that is pretty shocking
JamieJ1: i didn't tell many people when i was in the academy so i wouldn't jinx myself
Terry_VB: I understand
JamieJ1: that just doesn't seem shocking enough though*L*
Terry_VB: that's pretty major, Jamie
JamieJ1: well, it's jsut another piece of me that you know now
Terry_VB: which only makes you hotter in my eyes
JamieJ1: stop....you're making me blush*L*
Terry_VB: lol, doesn't every gay guy have a fantasy about doing it with a cop?
JamieJ1: i don't know.....
Terry_VB: most do, I would imagine
Terry_VB: it's the authority thing
JamieJ1: it must be the uniform
JamieJ1: ...or the cuffs*L*
Terry_VB: yeah, that could be it
Terry_VB: sorry, was off in my daydream
JamieJ1: that's alright....i'm still here
Terry_VB: so what made you change jobs?
JamieJ1: i got tired of all of the traveling....
Terry_VB: yeah I can imagine that would get old
JamieJ1: and, i've wanted to become a cop for a while so i decided to go for it
Terry_VB: I'm glad you're following your passions
JamieJ1: so am i.....
Terry_VB: and it's always good to know someone on the force
JamieJ1: lol....well, i know a lot of them
Terry_VB: no, I meant for me to know someone
JamieJ1: i know....i was only playin with ya
Terry_VB: I already have a friend with the sheriff's dept
Terry_VB: and I used to know two lesbians that work for VB, but I only knew them through 
        my friend Thomas 
Terry_VB: and he's not in the picture anymore
JamieJ1: yeah, a lot of the women who are on the deoartment are lesbians
Terry_VB: I can imagine
Terry_VB: oh!  so the guy you had sex with is a police officer, too?
JamieJ1: no....he was a friend
Terry_VB: ah
Terry_VB: damn, there went that fantasy
JamieJ1: i met him through a guy i used to work with in my last job
Terry_VB: brb
JamieJ1: ok
Terry_VB: sorry, I'm back
Terry_VB: I was trying to find my gum.  I don't know what I did with it
JamieJ1: ah...i was gonna ask if everything was okay
Terry_VB: yeah, just a chewing gum emergency
JamieJ1: lol.....look out...sounds dangerous
Terry_VB: it could be
Terry_VB: I'm a serious Extra Polar Ice addict
JamieJ1: i like orbit
Terry_VB: I don't guess I've ever tried that
JamieJ1: that's all i chew now....
Terry_VB: I'll have to try it
JamieJ1: so...the whole cop thing was enough to tell then?
Terry_VB: yup.  That's the kind of thing I want to know when I ask "what's new?"
JamieJ1: ah...sorry about that....*L*
JamieJ1: okay...it's your turn then..
Terry_VB: we better save mine for next time
JamieJ1: i don't think so.....
Terry_VB: no, really... cuz it might blow your socks off
Terry_VB: and will likely spur a lengthy conversation
JamieJ1: well, that's okay.....i'm up for it if you are...
JamieJ1: but...if you really don't wanna say it....it's okay....
Terry_VB: I just know it's 5:20 a.m. and don't want to hit you with a brick wall and then 
        keep you up longer than you want to stay
JamieJ1: hey...i can stay up for a long time
Terry_VB: I'm sure, but I don't know that I can
JamieJ1: but...no pressure though
Terry_VB: oh, well if there's no pressure
JamieJ1: but i do have to say that you've peaked my curiosity now....
JamieJ1: i'm gonna have a hard time gettin to sleep*L*
Terry_VB: you would have an even harder time if I told you tonight
JamieJ1: dammit!!!!!
Terry_VB: To be continued...
JamieJ1: this sucks.....
JamieJ1: i think i just got the short end of this deal
Terry_VB: I'm sorry.  I think you're right.
JamieJ1: what time are you going to bed?
Terry_VB: I don't know.  I'm buzzing on chocolate, but I took a muscle relaxer 
        hoping it would knock me out... it's hard to say which will win
JamieJ1: well, i think you should tell me now...and we'll come up with something 
        new for the next time....
Terry_VB: what does your cop instincts tell you?
Terry_VB: or what do they tell you, rather
JamieJ1: oh no.....you don't get off that easy....
Terry_VB: why not?
JamieJ1: because i said so..*L*...
JamieJ1: besides...i used my cop sense all night...it's time to give it a break
Terry_VB: to be honest, I'm actually quite surprised you haven't figured it out yet
JamieJ1: what can i say....my mind isn't working on all cylinders now....
Terry_VB: I don't mean right now
Terry_VB: I mean since you came back into my life
Terry_VB: I even sent you the poem about it
Terry_VB: oh now the wheels are turnin
JamieJ1: well, of course....but still......
JamieJ1: i tell you what...i'm gonna go pee.....if you wanna tell me then that will be the 
        time...if not it's perfectly okay....
Terry_VB: ok
JamieJ1: okie doke....i'm back
Terry_VB: I'm still here
JamieJ1: okay...so, now what shall we chat about?
Terry_VB: naw, I'm gonna tell you
JamieJ1: it's okay if you don't....
Terry_VB: no.  I have been carrying the weight of not telling you for too long.  it's just been
        very difficult finding the courage, but I only asked you the question in hopes you 
        would ask me in return (which you did)
Terry_VB: On June 13, 2003 (Friday the 13th), I was diagnosed with HIV.  
JamieJ1: omg......terry...i'm so sorry.....
JamieJ1: you know.....that explains a lot....
Terry_VB: of course it does
JamieJ1: how are you doing with it?
Terry_VB: how do you think?
JamieJ1: rough.....i know.....
Terry_VB: nah
Terry_VB: where do you think all the poems have come from?
Terry_VB: and the one titled "Three Scarlet Letters"
Terry_VB: "I have three scarlet letters
Terry_VB: I wear upon my chest
Terry_VB: I take them everywhere I go
Terry_VB: Even unto my death
JamieJ1: omg
Terry_VB: you didn't see it
JamieJ1: i did and i didn't
Terry_VB: *nods*  it doesn't matter.  It was not time
JamieJ1: i thought that maybe you did but i guess denial set in
Terry_VB: yeah, I'm quite familiar with that
JamieJ1: how's your family doing?
Terry_VB: they don't know
Terry_VB: well, my aunt Nancy and cousin Jackie (who live in VB) do
JamieJ1: but your parents don't
Terry_VB: no
JamieJ1: do they know you're gay?
Terry_VB: I told my mom back in 2000 when I was with Buddy, but I've never officially 
        come out to my dad, brother, or sister, though they HAVE to know.  I haven't had a
        girlfriend or even liked one since HS
Terry_VB: we just dont' talk about it
Terry_VB: I told you it was a brick wall
JamieJ1: i'm so sorry.....
JamieJ1: it is....
Terry_VB: I understand, Jamie
Terry_VB: to this point, telling you has been the hardest of all that I've told
JamieJ1: oh...i can understand that....but i'm glad you told me
Terry_VB: It wasn't a matter of if... just when
Terry_VB: you read my story Blessed Assurance, right?
JamieJ1: i take it you're taking the meds?
Terry_VB: naw
JamieJ1: i have
Terry_VB: no meds for me
JamieJ1: why not?
Terry_VB: do you realize that the night I spent in the psych ward after trying to kill myself 
        was Friday the 13th... and the day I was diagnosed with HIV was also Friday the 
        13th
Terry_VB: because I'm healthy
JamieJ1: wow
Terry_VB: but my life, for the most part, is just like it was
Terry_VB: some days are good
Terry_VB: some days aren't so good
JamieJ1: but, they're making strides in the medical fiels when it comes to hiv....
JamieJ1: fields*
Terry_VB: yup.  
Terry_VB: I've done my homework
JamieJ1: i bet you have....
Terry_VB: I wasn't ignorant of HIV before I was infected
JamieJ1: do you mind me asking how you became infected?
Terry_VB: you know you can ask me anything
Terry_VB: I got it from having unprotected sex with this flight attendant from Florida
JamieJ1: did he know he was infected?
Terry_VB: said he didn't, but that was a moot point to me 
JamieJ1: `i can understand taht
Terry_VB: it didn't matter where or how... that morning when I found out, I knew all I had 
        to worry about was what to do now
Terry_VB: though looking back, I knew when it was happening
Terry_VB: I just didn't listen to my gut
Terry_VB: I am hard headed as you know
JamieJ1: lol.....yeah..we all are sometimes
Terry_VB: but I chose this path and have to make the most of it
Terry_VB: come what may
JamieJ1: i certainly didn't want to hear that happening to you
JamieJ1: yeah....but still
Terry_VB: who would wish it upon anyone?
Terry_VB: it's certainly not an easy path
JamieJ1: no...you're right
Terry_VB: I always think of Mother Teresa's quote where she said, "I know that God 
        will never give me more than I can handle. I just wish He didn't trust me so much."
JamieJ1: yeah really......
Terry_VB: but I am a much stronger person now
JamieJ1: it would have to make you that way....
JamieJ1: but...it's still bringing a tear to my eye
Terry_VB: :-\   
Terry_VB: well, if I was there, I'd lend you my shoulder
JamieJ1: yeah...i know....
Terry_VB: and I know a thousand and one thoughts are going through your mind
JamieJ1: yes they are 
Terry_VB: I hear them
Terry_VB: like I said, you can ask me anything
JamieJ1: i suppose that's teh way it works..
JamieJ1: the*
Terry_VB: what do you mean?
JamieJ1: questions and thoughts.....
Terry_VB: usually, yeah
JamieJ1: one thought brings up 2 questions...and 1 question brings up 2 thoughts
Terry_VB: *nods*  well, you need to understand that I am quite ok with all of 
        this.  I don't know how I do it, but I do 
JamieJ1: i know....and that's so impressive
Terry_VB: I don't believe in letting myself feel down for long.  There are so many others 
        whose circumstances are far greater and challenging
JamieJ1: how did you find this out?
Terry_VB: how did I find out I was HIV+?
JamieJ1: yeah
Terry_VB: I got tested regularly
Terry_VB: but I just had a feeling
JamieJ1: ah....i didn't know if something happened that made you get tested or if 
        you got tested regularly
Terry_VB: I always got tested every 6 months if not more frequently.  I had good insurance
        so it didn't cost me anything
JamieJ1: well, thank you for telling me today......thank you very much
Terry_VB: not telling you was putting a strain on our conversations
Terry_VB: you were only seeing the carefully crafted mask that I wear so eloquently
JamieJ1: well, i hope you don't mind but i'm gonna keep you in my prayers
Terry_VB: why would I mind?
JamieJ1: i didn't think you would.....it's jsut a way of saying i'll be thinking of you
Terry_VB: ah.  well, you don't ever need to ask my permission for that.  
JamieJ1: good...cause it didn't matter if you wanted me to or not...i was gonna do it 
        anyways*L*
Terry_VB: when you pray, remember that powerful is the prayer filled with gratitude
JamieJ1: well, i still think you're great....and sexy....
Terry_VB: thanks.  You better, dammit!
JamieJ1: lol...i do....
JamieJ1: i can see i'm gonna spend most of the day reading up on hiv
Terry_VB: there's a lot of info out there
JamieJ1: i know...i'll be looking it up
JamieJ1: ..and if there's anything i can ever do...jsut ask
Terry_VB: I appreciate that, but I don't usually ask for much
JamieJ1: well, if you ever do....even for just a shoulder to cry on....all you have to do is 
        ask
Terry_VB: again, thank you... but I doubt you will ever see that
Terry_VB: I think I've maybe cried 4 times since I found out
Terry_VB: no, 5
JamieJ1: lol...get it right dammit!!!!!!
Terry_VB: I know, right
Terry_VB: and I'm not counting movies
JamieJ1: have you had sex since then?
Terry_VB: oh hell yeah
JamieJ1: jsut checkin
Terry_VB: though for a long time I wrote sex off
Terry_VB: I was angry at myself
JamieJ1: why?
Terry_VB: for being foolish
Terry_VB: not listening to my instincts
Terry_VB: always pushing my limits
JamieJ1: like you said....what happened is what happened
Terry_VB: yeah, I know.  But anger is a big part of the grieving process
JamieJ1: yes it is
Terry_VB: I know it's hard to believe, but I'm a much happier person now than I was 
        before
JamieJ1: no...i can believe that...things now have a much different look to you
Terry_VB: well, some things do.  A lot of things I once feared, I don't
Terry_VB: like dying
Terry_VB: but I guess that never really scared me
JamieJ1: it shouldn't...doesn't scare me either
Terry_VB: my Astrology has probably been the biggest help through all of this
JamieJ1: it's important to find things that help...
Terry_VB: *nods*  Gay.com's HIV Pos room was a big help, too
JamieJ1: good
Terry_VB: brb.  gotta pee
JamieJ1: i'll be here
Terry_VB: ok I'm back
Terry_VB: I feel much better 
JamieJ1: hey...i do need to ask you for a favor
Terry_VB: ok
JamieJ1: i had to reload my computer the other day....can you send me your pics 
        again....please??????
Terry_VB: all of them?
JamieJ1: if you don't mind....
Terry_VB: no problem
JamieJ1: i miss having them
Terry_VB: I dont' know what ones I sent you, because the only ones in my sent files are
        the ones of my dick
JamieJ1: and those are ones i definitely want*L*
Terry_VB: lol
Terry_VB: ok, done
JamieJ1: thank you  :-)
Terry_VB: it might take a minute... I sent you like 10 pics
Terry_VB: now give me one without sunglasses!
Terry_VB: ;-)
JamieJ1: yeah...i just checked it and they weren't there
JamieJ1: i will...i'll get some taken today and i'll send it to you
Terry_VB: well you don't have to do it today
Terry_VB: I've waited this long
Terry_VB: but sometime soon would be nice
JamieJ1: i'll do it
JamieJ1: and i got them...thanks
JamieJ1: i really like the Mr. Happy shot
Terry_VB: you've always liked that picture
JamieJ1: yes i have....
Terry_VB: I am having major withdrawals for my gum
JamieJ1: you better go find that damn gum
Terry_VB: I guess I lost it somewhere 
Terry_VB: it's probably in my car somewhere
Terry_VB: I went out earlier and looked, but the sun wasn't up then
JamieJ1: well look...i think i better get going.....
Terry_VB: yeah, I could use some sleep myself
Terry_VB: and I'm sure your day will start earlier than mine
JamieJ1: maybe....i'm off today so i get to sleep in
Terry_VB: I just hope i can get to sleep
JamieJ1: you will.....
Terry_VB: eventually, yeah
JamieJ1: now that i've got that pic again i'm gonna go to bed and take care of some 
        "business" to help me sleep
Terry_VB: ok.  well I will talk to you later.  Have a great Sunday
JamieJ1: you do the same.....i'll talk to soon.....
Terry_VB: G'nite Jamie
JamieJ1: nite Terry
