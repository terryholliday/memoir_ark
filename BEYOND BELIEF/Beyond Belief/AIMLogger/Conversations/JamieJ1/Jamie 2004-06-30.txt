JamieJ1: lol....you never know
Terry_VB: how are you?
JamieJ1: not too bad...and you?
Terry_VB: got a bad sinus headache, but I'm 
        doing all right
Terry_VB: took a vicodin
JamieJ1: yeah...a vicodin might take care of 
        it*L*
Terry_VB: I would hope so
JamieJ1: it will take care of the headache...and
        any other pain you have
Terry_VB: so how was your day?
JamieJ1: it was pretty good....i got a haircut
Terry_VB: you were off today?
JamieJ1: yeah...i needed a day to relax a little
Terry_VB: well if you didn't take those days 
        you'd burn out
JamieJ1: oh yeah.....and we can't have that
Terry_VB: nope.  So what brings you online so 
        late?
JamieJ1: several things.....nothing on tv...and i 
        just wanted to see what was going on
Terry_VB: yeah, there is never anything good 
        on tv at this hour
JamieJ1: no....if i'm up at thise hour i usually 
        just pop in a movie
Terry_VB: now is usually when I catch up on 
        my taped shows
JamieJ1: another good thing to do
Terry_VB: but not nearly as good as keeping 
        you company
JamieJ1: awww....stop that...you're making me
        blush
Terry_VB: you know it's true
JamieJ1: well, i certainly appreciate you saying
        that
Terry_VB: always glad to say it
JamieJ1: what are you doing online so late?
Terry_VB: yawning at the moment
Terry_VB: I was horny!
JamieJ1: you was?
Terry_VB: but then I got frustrated with that and
        was about to log off when you said hello
Terry_VB: yeah
JamieJ1: well, don't let me keep you from 
        anything...if you need to leave it's all good
Terry_VB: no I don't want to leave now that I'm 
        talking to you
JamieJ1: what did you do today?
Terry_VB: I worked this evening and didn't 
        really do anything before work but watch 
        TV
JamieJ1: sounds like a fairly easy day
Terry_VB: work wasn't... I ran my ass off
JamieJ1: well, sounds like a fairly easy day 
        before work then....
Terry_VB: yeah, I don't usually do much before 
        I go in to work in the evenings... that time 
        is usually set aside for mentally preparing
        myself
Terry_VB: pumping myself up
JamieJ1: hey...you gotta do what you gotta do
Terry_VB: yeah, some days it's easier than 
        others
JamieJ1: oh...i know the feeling
Terry_VB: so how long are you going to be on 
        this night shift schedule?
JamieJ1: for a long time i think
Terry_VB: well at least I'll get to see more of 
        you
JamieJ1: yeah, until yo ustart going to bed a ta 
        decent hour
Terry_VB: yeah, actually next month when I 
        start school I won't be able to stay up all 
        night

        chat

        light
JamieJ1: they are......we keep things pretty 
        easy
JamieJ1: it's our pillow-talk*L*
Terry_VB: well, pillow talk is supposed to 
        come after sex

JamieJ1: ah...i knew i was doing something 
        wrong
Terry_VB: bass ackwards
JamieJ1: i do that a lot*L*
Terry_VB: why is that?

        yet
