JamieJ1: yeah....it wasn't too bad...
JamieJ1: did the e-mail go through?
Terry_VB: yeah, just got my outlook to open
Terry_VB: wow that got my heart beating
JamieJ1: i was wondering if i did that whole 
        e-,ail attachment thing right
Terry_VB: oh it worked
JamieJ1: good...
Terry_VB: and thank you
JamieJ1: told you they weren't anything to get 
        worked up over...
Terry_VB: naw, just raised my blood pressure
JamieJ1: lol
Terry_VB: I mean I knew I was going to like it
Terry_VB: but it's awesome
JamieJ1: well, thank you .....i do appreciate 
        that
Terry_VB: I guess because it's you and all the 
        anticipation I've built up over the years 
        wondering what it really looked like, but 
        I've never had anyone's dick picture leave 
        me at a loss for words after seeing it
JamieJ1: wow...i didn't think it was all 
        that.....thank you
Terry_VB: it's because it's yours
JamieJ1: i even made sure i was trimmed up 
        and everything*L*
Terry_VB: I saw that
Terry_VB: :-)
JamieJ1: i'm sorry about the ones in bad 
        light.....i wanted to see if there's was 
        enough ambient light.....i don't think there 
        was
Terry_VB: it's ok.  gave me an idea of what it 
        looks like in subdued lighting
JamieJ1: lol.....well, i never thought of it that 
        way
Terry_VB: you always make me see the 
        brighter side of things
JamieJ1: well, i'm glad you liked them
Terry_VB: I figured out the other day that's why I
        always enjoy talking to you
JamieJ1: i always try to have a positive spin on
        things....
Terry_VB: *nods*
JamieJ1: but, so do you......we're 2 peas in a 
        pod
Terry_VB: yeah, but I am moody and pick up 
        other people's moods
Terry_VB: I feed off of the energy of whoever 
        I'm around
Terry_VB: and it's hard sometimes for me to 
        repel the negative vibes
JamieJ1: then hang around positive people 
        and you'll be fine
Terry_VB: I do.  At least I always try to
JamieJ1: there ya go
Terry_VB: you have to work today?
JamieJ1: you still here?
JamieJ1: oh...there you are
JamieJ1: yeah...i sure do
Terry_VB: yeah, I was off in space for a minute
Terry_VB: I get lost in my thoughts a lot
JamieJ1: that's alright.....we're all allowed 
        moments like that
Terry_VB: that's good, because I always have
JamieJ1: its okay to get lost in your 
        thoughts....as long as you find your way 
        back
Terry_VB: yeah, reality always interrupts
JamieJ1: it's a bitch
Terry_VB: yup. just like the movie... Reality 
        Bites
JamieJ1: you know i've never seen that movie
Terry_VB: me, either, but when you said that, 
        it's what I thought of
Terry_VB: hey, I need to step away for a 
        minute.   I'll brb 
JamieJ1: okie doke.....
Terry_VB: ok I'm back
Terry_VB: sorry, I just realized I hadn't eaten 
        anything all day
JamieJ1: i was wonderin what you were up to
Terry_VB: yup
Terry_VB: I heated up some spaghetti
JamieJ1: that was my next question
Terry_VB: ;-)  that's pretty good, answering your
        questions before you ask them
JamieJ1: you must be psychic*L*
Terry_VB: I am
Terry_VB: but we all are to some degree
Terry_VB: we all have gut feelings
Terry_VB: damn, that was good spaghetti
JamieJ1: in meat sauce?
Terry_VB: yeah
JamieJ1: very good
Terry_VB: *burp*
JamieJ1: nice...a true sign that the meal was 
        good
Terry_VB: or that I'll pay dearly for eating that 
        hamburger
Terry_VB: which I will
JamieJ1: lol....hey...positive...remember??
Terry_VB: that's right.  just because 
        hamburger used to cause me great 
        distress doesn't mean it will this time
JamieJ1: yeah.......and if it does....then 
        ..uuummm....sorry about that.....
Terry_VB: I don't know why I developed an 
        allergy to red meat
JamieJ1: oohh.....i'd hate that...i love red meat
Terry_VB: it just tears my stomach up
Terry_VB: seafood and chicken doesn't do it 
        though
Terry_VB: it's just like I can't drink milk 
        anymore
JamieJ1: damn...all the food i like you can't eat
Terry_VB: yeah, I know.  I used to love them, 
        too
Terry_VB: I grew up in a house where we went 
        through 6 gallons of milk a week
JamieJ1: yeah...we did the same
Terry_VB: the guy at the Foodland used to call 
        my mom the milk lady b/c she was always
        in there buying milk
Terry_VB: but now if I drink it, I'm sick in the 
        bed for 2 days
JamieJ1: well....don't drink it
Terry_VB: I don't.  I drink soy milk now
Terry_VB: it's actually good
JamieJ1: i think i'll stick to the real thing
Terry_VB: and I don't blame you
JamieJ1: alright sexy.....i think it's about 
        bedtime
Terry_VB: yup.  me, too
Terry_VB: have a good night
JamieJ1: you do the same......hope your 
        tummy's okay
Terry_VB: thanks.  it will be
Terry_VB: sweet dreams
