terry_holliday: what do you think of the new gay.com chat?
jamiej6162002: i don't like it
terry_holliday: it's definitely different
jamiej6162002: yeah.....i guess it will take some time getting used to....only thing is i don't go to gay.com much anymore
terry_holliday: me, either
jamiej6162002: i've noticed
terry_holliday: well, I told you I wasn't gonna

jamiej6162002: i understand that
terry_holliday: brrr.  I am cold
jamiej6162002: i know....it got cold fast
jamiej6162002: ...i need to buy some more heating oil
terry_holliday: I hope we have a mild winter
jamiej6162002: i want a cold winter...with lots of snow
terry_holliday: bite your tongue
jamiej6162002: heck no!.....i'm a winter person
terry_holliday: do you not know that it's going to cost a lot more for heating this winter?
jamiej6162002: i know...i saw that prices are going up
jamiej6162002: but still....i like the cold
terry_holliday: I don't like $250 power bills, though
jamiej6162002: snow, nice crisp mornings, cuddling.....what's not to like about the cold????
jamiej6162002: oh...me either.....
terry_holliday: you have someone to cuddle with?
terry_holliday: cuz I don't
jamiej6162002: no....but still....
terry_holliday: so cold mornings in bed with no one to keep you warm aren't that great
terry_holliday: =)~
jamiej6162002: well....that's true....HEY....stop trying to ruin my point here
terry_holliday: you're right.  I shouldn't look at the negative side
terry_holliday: I should keep wishin and hopin
jamiej6162002: that's about all we have
terry_holliday: I'll be back in a few
jamiej6162002: okay
terry_holliday: I need to run downstairs before Will & Grace comes on
jamiej6162002: okay....but don't trip
terry_holliday: back
jamiej6162002: did you get what you needed?
terry_holliday: well, I had to take my dishes back downstairs
jamiej6162002: dinner?
terry_holliday: from dinner, yes
jamiej6162002: what did you have?
terry_holliday: just a tuna fish sandwich
jamiej6162002: eeeeeewwwwwww.....tuna fish
terry_holliday: no.  yum. tuna fish
jamiej6162002: oh no....that stuff is nasty!
terry_holliday: not mixed with mayonnaise
jamiej6162002: i'd rather eat the jar of Mayo
terry_holliday: yuck
jamiej6162002: so, whta are you going to be for halloween?
terry_holliday: most likely, nothing.  My cousin Jackie is having a party next Saturday night, but I will most likely have to work.  My dad is having surgery on the 30th, so I'll be in WV for Halloween day
jamiej6162002: what's he having surgery for?
terry_holliday: he's got blockage in the arteries in his neck
terry_holliday: he had a stroke about a month ago
jamiej6162002: uh-oh...i hope he's alright
terry_holliday: I hope so, too
terry_holliday: I'm worried about the surgery.  His dad died from the same surgery back in 91
jamiej6162002: they've made a lot of advances in surgery since then though
jamiej6162002: he'll be alright
terry_holliday: I hope so
jamiej6162002: have faith
jamiej6162002: anyone special in your life?
terry_holliday: lol
terry_holliday: nope
jamiej6162002: lol....damn....
jamiej6162002: okay
terry_holliday: I don't expect there will be anytime soon
jamiej6162002: that's okay......
terry_holliday: of course it is
jamiej6162002: i'm the same way
jamiej6162002: still forced to take care of things myself*L*
terry_holliday: well, that's by choice
jamiej6162002: i know.....
jamiej6162002: but, it's fun someitmes
jamiej6162002: hell....it's fun most of the times*L*
terry_holliday: apparently I dont' have as much fun jerking off
jamiej6162002: why not?
terry_holliday: it's a chore
jamiej6162002: well...you just have to find something that makes it a chore you want
jamiej6162002: it's not as good as the real thing but it can still be pretty nice
terry_holliday: *shrugs*  or I can just hookup
jamiej6162002: true....i know you can....but still...i actually like doing it myself...
terry_holliday: whatever works  :-)
jamiej6162002: amen to that!!!*S*
jamiej6162002: i think it's gonna be an early bed night for me tonight
terry_holliday: *nods*  I am kinda tuckered myself
jamiej6162002: i don't know why but i haven't been sleeping good lately and i think it's starting to catch up with me
terry_holliday: well yeah... it has a way of doing that
jamiej6162002: i'm starting to figure that out....
terry_holliday: Tomorrow is my day off, so at least I can sleep in
jamiej6162002: i have to work....have to wake up at 5:00
terry_holliday: then you should get a good night's sleep
jamiej6162002: that's even too early to get morning wood*L*
terry_holliday: NEVER too early
jamiej6162002: lol
jamiej6162002: wel...maybe you're right
terry_holliday: but it's too early for me to do anything about it
jamiej6162002: i'll jsut piss it away
terry_holliday: works everytime
jamiej6162002: that's why i'll try to work it all out tonight so i don't have to deal with it in the morning
terry_holliday: sounds like a good plan
jamiej6162002: always a good plan....i still have a high libido
terry_holliday: thanks for sharing
terry_holliday: always good to know 
jamiej6162002: sorry...maybe too much info
terry_holliday: oh, you know it's all good.  You can tell me anything
jamiej6162002: okay...i shaved today
terry_holliday: your balls?
jamiej6162002: everything....
terry_holliday: everything... down there?
jamiej6162002: all of it...smooth as a baby's butt
terry_holliday: ack
jamiej6162002: oh no....i like it
terry_holliday: well, since you're the only one that sees it, I guess that's all that counts
jamiej6162002: gee....thanks for reminding me
terry_holliday: <== such an astute for pointing out the obvious
jamiej6162002: you never cease to amaze me
terry_holliday: alas, and that's why you hunted me down
terry_holliday: ;-)
jamiej6162002: of course....i had to keep the possibility open
terry_holliday: we always have a way of finding each other... eventually
jamiej6162002: we can sense each other's......
jamiej6162002: ...b.rainwaves.....
terry_holliday: naw, just means we haven't served our full purposes in each other's lives
terry_holliday: ..unfinished business
jamiej6162002: that very well could be
jamiej6162002: well...jsut so you know...i do still fantasize about you
terry_holliday: and that's still flattering as it always has been
jamiej6162002: i'd hoped it would be
terry_holliday: sorry... had to go put on some long pants
jamiej6162002: that's okay....
jamiej6162002: ...i was getting ready to see if you were still there or if i drew you away
terry_holliday: nah, I'm here
jamiej6162002: gettin too cold for ya?
terry_holliday: very
terry_holliday: I've got chill bumps all over
jamiej6162002: all over?
terry_holliday: well, my arms and legs
jamiej6162002: you better put a long sleeved shirt on then too
terry_holliday: I'm hoping these pull-apart pants warm me up
jamiej6162002: nothing wrong with the pull apart pants
terry_holliday: nope.  easy access
jamiej6162002: damn skippy...for those moments when ya just need to get to it
terry_holliday: exactly
jamiej6162002: maybe i should get me a pair....i'm jsut wearing these joe boxers
jamiej6162002: jsut
jamiej6162002: just
terry_holliday: again, thanks for sharing
jamiej6162002: ah....joe boxer pants....not boxers
terry_holliday: ahhh
jamiej6162002: i'm not meaning to give you a mental picture
terry_holliday: thanks, cuz that would just be mean to torment me 
jamiej6162002: yeah....and we both know that that isn't my style
terry_holliday: of course not
jamiej6162002: but then again...it's fun to toment you a little*L*
terry_holliday: yup.  I kinda gathered that
jamiej6162002: lol
jamiej6162002: sorry
terry_holliday: nah, it's ok.  
jamiej6162002: i won't tease....
terry_holliday: you know you wil
terry_holliday: will
jamiej6162002: lol....i know
terry_holliday: just plain mean
jamiej6162002: i am.....but it's fun
jamiej6162002: besides...it torments me too....
terry_holliday: yes, but that turns you on
jamiej6162002: i have to admit...it does...
terry_holliday: I know it does
jamiej6162002: get's me wriled up everytime
terry_holliday: what will you do if one day I stop playing?
jamiej6162002: ....i don't know.....
jamiej6162002: ....i'd probably go into breakdown and be lost
terry_holliday: yeah.
jamiej6162002: or i'd march over there and confront ya
terry_holliday: naw, because then you'd be giving me what I have wanted for almost 2 years
terry_holliday: and the fun would end
jamiej6162002: you think that that's what i'm after?
terry_holliday: what's that??
jamiej6162002: ....jsut playing
jamiej6162002: just
terry_holliday: I've learned to accept this for what it is
jamiej6162002: ...and what is it?
terry_holliday: an online friendship full of innocent flirtations that most likely will never go beyond just that
jamiej6162002: well...i certainly hope that's not the case.  i know that i'm the one making it that though
terry_holliday: even if it is, that's ok
jamiej6162002: it's nice to hear that......but i still have a complex about my hesitation
terry_holliday: I know
terry_holliday: and I can't do anything about that
jamiej6162002: i know you can't....that's all me
terry_holliday: The time just isn't right for you
jamiej6162002: it's still frustrating....know that i can do someting that i really want to do and not being able to act on it
jamiej6162002: i mean Terry, i've had fantasies before, but none of them have been this profound
terry_holliday: I wish I could tell you something that would make you be able to accept that part of you that you don't want to, but I can't.  You will in time, but only when you're ready.
jamiej6162002: i know...you can't wave a magic wand
jamiej6162002: well....not you know what i mean
terry_holliday: At least we have this...
jamiej6162002: oh yeah...i love chatting with you....i know that i can tell you anything and i won't be weird
jamiej6162002: ..well..not too weird*L*
terry_holliday: you can... 
terry_holliday: and I think that's why your fantasies are as intense as they are
terry_holliday: because you can be yourself with me and not worry about judgment
jamiej6162002: yeah...that is probably a good reason
terry_holliday: and you'll always have that with me, no matter what
jamiej6162002: you have no idea how much i appreciate that...
terry_holliday: I do... ;-)  
jamiej6162002: you know how you said that me teasing you turned me on....
terry_holliday: yeah
jamiej6162002: the truth is that i get turned on when i see you're online....
jamiej6162002: i saw you wer on yahoo and i began to grow
terry_holliday: and you're the only person I know that can make me be at a loss for words
jamiej6162002: ....i didn't mean to embarrass you.....
terry_holliday: it's not embarrassment
jamiej6162002: but it's that that makesmy situation that much more confusing....but i know that i'll come to terms with it one day
terry_holliday: are you afraid that you'll fall for me?
jamiej6162002: to be honest....no.....i'
jamiej6162002: mi'm not afraid of falling for anyone....and i'm not afraid of being with a man....sexualy....
jamiej6162002: that's the kicker.....i don't think i'm afraid....
terry_holliday: then what is it?
jamiej6162002: if i could answer that then i'
jamiej6162002: then i'd be over there right now
terry_holliday: tell me your thoughts
terry_holliday: you have to know what it is
jamiej6162002: no...i really don't....it hasn't been made clear to me yet
jamiej6162002: i guess one thing is that i'd go into it only for companionship and passion and you'd want something else.  but you've already clarified that for me
terry_holliday: so you're afraid I'd fall for you?
jamiej6162002: maybe
terry_holliday: well, that's an easy fix
jamiej6162002: that's what i meant when i said that you have already clarified that....
jamiej6162002: i'm just a mental case
terry_holliday: no, you're just confused
terry_holliday: why don't you hook up with someone from the chat room
jamiej6162002: i told you that if i have sex with a man you're going to be the one i want it with
terry_holliday: what happens if I am in a relationship?
jamiej6162002: then i go without.......and that's alright
jamiej6162002: ...look...neither want no intend to give you teh runaround.  if this gets too frustrating for you or if oyu simply want to drop it then i understand.  i actually wouldn't be able to blame you.
terry_holliday: Jamie, I already told you... I'm ok with things the way they are.
jamiej6162002: i know....but i'm simply giving you the out....for now or the future
terry_holliday: don't worry.  If I want out of something, I get out of it
jamiej6162002: i'm sure you do
terry_holliday: On some level, however sick it is, I apparently like the teasing and idea of meeting you...for whatever 
jamiej6162002: i don't think it's sick.....and there's nothing wrong with liking to be teased
terry_holliday: well, to me, there is
jamiej6162002: i'm sorry that i am in some way aiding you in doing something that you feel is wrong
terry_holliday: It's the eternal optimist side of me that you appeal to
jamiej6162002: well...i'm glad that i appeal to some side of you, but if you feel that being teased is wrong for  you then that's something we should deal with
terry_holliday: I do it because I know you like it
jamiej6162002: but you shouldn't do it for that......if you don't like it then don't do it...
terry_holliday: I'm sorry I took the conversation in this direction.  
jamiej6162002: oh....you don't have to be sorry...there's nothing to be sorry about
jamiej6162002: ...it's all good
jamiej6162002: do you hear me?
terry_holliday: I hear you
jamiej6162002: yo ubetter
terry_holliday: ask me if I believe you
jamiej6162002: do you believe me?
terry_holliday: no
jamiej6162002: you should.....it really is okay....
terry_holliday: to a certain extent, yes
jamiej6162002: it's all good....i do enjoy chatting with you.....i, from the bottom of my heart, don't want to do anything that you don't enjoy....
terry_holliday: Jamie, I love flirting with you... I just hate that I can't find a guy like you to have more than just innocent flirtations with
jamiej6162002: i know.....and i'm not wanting to add to that....i jsut say what i want to say and it sounds good
jamiej6162002: well look Terry....i hate to stop chatting with you ...especially after i found you after all this time...but i really should be going.
terry_holliday: I know.  :-)
jamiej6162002: i have some "business" to attend to and then it's off to bed
terry_holliday: *nods*  
terry_holliday: Thanks for the chat
terry_holliday: It was a pleasure, as always
jamiej6162002: oh no....thank you....
jamiej6162002: you better have your hayoo on so i can find ya
