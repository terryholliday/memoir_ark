JamieJ1: hey there
Terry_VB: hey Jamie
JamieJ1: what in the world are you still doin 
        up?
Terry_VB: reading a new book I got
Terry_VB: what are you still doing up?
JamieJ1: nothing.....what book is it?
Terry_VB: It's called The New Astrology.  It's a 
        combination of western and eastern 
        astrology
JamieJ1: very good
Terry_VB: I figured you went to bed.  I didn't get 
        in until late.  I went to the employee 
        after-party
JamieJ1: did ya have a good time?
Terry_VB: eh
Terry_VB: I would've rather been home
JamieJ1: oh...well, sorry about that
Terry_VB: I had to close tonight, so I was tired, 
        and in my work uniform
JamieJ1: what time did you end up gettin 
        home?
Terry_VB: about 2:40
Terry_VB: I took one of my coworkers home 
        because she was drunk
JamieJ1: ah...a designated driver...so 
        responsible
Terry_VB: well, after the hangover I had last 
        week from 2 drinks I wasn't about to drink 
        tonight
Terry_VB: no thanks
JamieJ1: lol...oh yeah...i almost forgot
Terry_VB: I didn't!
JamieJ1: i bet you didn't
Terry_VB: so how was your day?
JamieJ1: not too bad...i really didn't do 
        anything
JamieJ1: i went out tonight....that's why i'm just
        now getting online
JamieJ1: and why i'm so tired......
Terry_VB: where did you go?
JamieJ1: we just went bar hopping...and then 
        ended up at IHOp for breakfast
Terry_VB: hey, what year were you born?
Terry_VB: 73?
JamieJ1: 73
Terry_VB: ok
Terry_VB: you're a Gemini/Ox
JamieJ1: gemini
Terry_VB: yeah, but your eastern sign is the Ox
JamieJ1: i'm not sure...you now i don't keep up
        with astrology
Terry_VB: For the Gemini/Ox there are two 
        kinds of love.  There is family love, and 
        there is sexual love.  Otherwise, there isn't
        any love.
JamieJ1: so, what time did you end up going 
        to bed last night?
Terry_VB: a few minutes after you logged off
Terry_VB: I don't think I fell asleep though until 
        around 4:30/5
JamieJ1: why so late?
Terry_VB: It always takes me awhile to wind 
        down
JamieJ1: i'm like that from time to 
        time...usually i can go right to sleep
Terry_VB: I wish I could
Terry_VB: I just think too damn much
JamieJ1: yeah....i can just let it all go 
Terry_VB: lucky you 
JamieJ1: it all depends on my mood though
Terry_VB: well I guess mine does too
JamieJ1: but...i don't think i'm gonna have any 
        trouble tonight
Terry_VB: I don't figure I am, either
Terry_VB: brb. gotta put my work shirts in the 
        dryer
JamieJ1: i figured you'd fall right to sleep last 
        night seein how you were tired from the 
        trip
JamieJ1: okie doke
Terry_VB: yeah, I was but I had to jerk off
JamieJ1: oh.....so did i
Terry_VB: I'm back
JamieJ1: welcum back
Terry_VB: thank you
Terry_VB: so I found out tonight at the party that
        this new girl at work that I clicked with 
        wants to go to school for massage 
        therapy, too
JamieJ1: very good....you 2 can be study 
        mates
Terry_VB: yup
Terry_VB: if she's serious
JamieJ1: only time will tell
Terry_VB: you are correct
Terry_VB: I never realized until this trip home 
        how much my conversations with you are 
        like my conversations with my dad... we 
        talk, but on a intellectual, almost 
        superficial level
JamieJ1: uh-oh...just don't call me daddy*L*
Terry_VB: oh no
JamieJ1: i'm just teasin
Terry_VB: I know
Terry_VB: well I'm gonna have to get to bed.  I 
        can't keep my eyes open any longer
Terry_VB: thank you for the company
JamieJ1: okie doke...i think i'm gonna head 
        that way too
Terry_VB: sleep well, and have a good day 
        today

Terry_VB: g'nite
