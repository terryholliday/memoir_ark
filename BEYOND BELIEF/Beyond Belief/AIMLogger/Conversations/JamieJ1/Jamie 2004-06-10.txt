JamieJ1: hey there
JamieJ1: uuummmmm....maybe you're not there....
Terry_VB: hey Jamie
Terry_VB: sorry, didn't see the window
JamieJ1: that's okay...i figured yo were either not there or 
        busy
Terry_VB: no, just wasn't paying attention to gay.com and 
        didn't see the window
Terry_VB: how are you?
JamieJ1: i'm pretty good....and yourself?
Terry_VB: feeling pretty good
Terry_VB: restless, but nothing unsual for this time of 
        year
JamieJ1: that's always a good thing
JamieJ1: why are you restless?
Terry_VB: well, I'm generally a restless person, but even 
        more so when the Sun is in Gemini, because that 
        exacerbates my nervousness and resltessness
JamieJ1: oh...so what you're saying is you have trouble 
        with geminis*L*
Terry_VB: not at all.  In fact, I'm supposed to end up with 
        one according to my Astrology chart
Terry_VB: they are the sign I am most compatible with in 
        relationships
Terry_VB: and my Moon is in Gemini, so my emotions are
        VERY gemini like
Terry_VB: which is probably why we've always gotten 
        along
Terry_VB: you see bits of yourself in me
Terry_VB: and vice versa
JamieJ1: i've never really gotten into the whole astrology 
        thing
JamieJ1: so what are you up to tonight?
Terry_VB: was cleaning out my Inbox
Terry_VB: filing what I wanted to keep and throwing out 
        what I don't
JamieJ1: ah.....cleaning's good
Terry_VB: I didn't have anything else to do.  I didn't see 
        anyone in gay.com that caught my interest (when I 
        last looked)
Terry_VB: so I figured I may as well make good use of my
        time
JamieJ1: hey...there's nothing wrong with that....it's about 
        time i clean my comp up a little
Terry_VB: I'm going through a big transformation period
JamieJ1: and what are you transforming into?
Terry_VB: a stronger person
Terry_VB: a person with greater faith and love of life
Terry_VB: a more efficient person
JamieJ1: well, i've always thought of you as a strong 
        person to begin with
Terry_VB: most people do... I just don't always FEEL that 
        way
Terry_VB: and this past year has been the toughest of my 
        adult life
JamieJ1: well, most strong people don't...
Terry_VB: *nods*  yeah
JamieJ1: well, if it helps...i still think you're atrong, 
        efficient person
Terry_VB: that's because that's what I let you see
JamieJ1: it's not about what you let people see...everyone
        has times of weakness...but i get a good "feel" for 
        people.....
Terry_VB: Well, I appreciate that
Terry_VB: I like to think i'm a good judge of character, too
Terry_VB: and I'm not saying i'm not strong or efficient.  I 
        am just going through a process of shedding my 
        skin.
JamieJ1: well, don't shed too much...the skin you have is 
        pretty nice
Terry_VB: thanks.  did you see my new pics?
JamieJ1: no...you sent me some older ones but they're 
        the only ones i've seen
Terry_VB: the ones in my profile now
JamieJ1: oh yeah...i saw those...
JamieJ1: the ones that i can see at least
Terry_VB: well you've seen the private ones before
JamieJ1: yes i have......i see you 've posted some from a 
        few days ago
Terry_VB: yeah
Terry_VB: that's what I was talking about
JamieJ1: you're still cute ;-)
Terry_VB: well thank God
Terry_VB: I'm glad you still think so
JamieJ1: lol.....thank him very much
Terry_VB: i dunno how much longer my good looks will 
        last.  my hair is starting to thin out on the temples
JamieJ1: hey....mine's been thinning for years....
JamieJ1: it's nothing but a thing...
Terry_VB: it works for you, though
JamieJ1: it didn't for a while...it used to bother me....but 
        after a while i realized that i couldn't change it so i 
        just kept on going
Terry_VB: oh but I will change mine.  I don't care if I have 
        to get 2 more jobs to pay for the hair transplants
JamieJ1: but, thank you very much for saying that
Terry_VB: you don't understand.  I used to brush my hair 
        like 10 times a day when I was a kid.  My mom called
        me vanity smurf
JamieJ1: lol.....you have to do what you have to do
Terry_VB: yup
JamieJ1: but i still think you'd look good with or without 
        hair
Terry_VB: well, as reassuring as that is, you're not most 
        guys
JamieJ1: and don't you forget it either*L*
Terry_VB: don't worry.  I won't
Terry_VB: hey, I need to reboot.  my pc is locking up on 
        me
JamieJ1: okir dokie....i'll be here
Terry_VB: well, it stopped 
Terry_VB: I don't know why it does that.
JamieJ1: it's get's too worked up
Terry_VB: probably b/c I try to multi-task too many things 
        at once
JamieJ1: that' would be my guess
Terry_VB: AOL and Gay.com use up a lot of pc memory
JamieJ1: i don't know about aol....but gay.com does use 
        a lot
Terry_VB: well, aol uses twice as much as having 4 IE 
        windows open with gay.com
JamieJ1: well, that can't be good
Terry_VB: naw, so that's why it hangs up sometimes
JamieJ1: ya gotta hate it when it hangs up sometimes
Terry_VB: so why are you up so late?
JamieJ1: i work nights now...and it's my day off...so i try to 
        stay up late to keep the same sleep schedule
Terry_VB: I see.  So you stay up until when?
JamieJ1: i'll be up until 5:00 probably...maybe a little later
Terry_VB: I didn't go to bed last night till 5:30 and that was
        b/c I took Nyquil
JamieJ1: why are you staying up so late...getting some 
        hot dates???
Terry_VB: are you kidding?!?  99.9995% of the guys that 
        troll the rooms at this hour are  looking for one thing
Terry_VB: the hot ones have already hooked up
Terry_VB: and it progressively gets worse the rest of the 
        night
JamieJ1: i hear that...i've already had about 10 
        propositions
Terry_VB: until about 6 when the married bisexuals start 
        coming online
JamieJ1: that's something i'd never even consider....i 
        won't mess around with married people
Terry_VB: I used to feel that way, too
JamieJ1: not any more?
Terry_VB: nah.  fuck it.  I can't discriminate
JamieJ1: lol...equal opportunity sex...you gotta love it
Terry_VB: yup.  EEOS
Terry_VB: or I guess just the EOS
JamieJ1: that should be a government agency
Terry_VB: I think we should start a program for sex 
        addicts
JamieJ1: now terry...are you a sex addict????.....lol
Terry_VB: boy wouldn't the gay.com stock drop then
Terry_VB: yes, I am a sex addict
JamieJ1: lol..you know it would just turn into a place 
        where guys could meet and screw...
JamieJ1: not that there's anything wrong with that....
Terry_VB: well yeah... but that's where you make the $$.  
        You open up a bath house across the street and 
        charge $25 admission
JamieJ1: that's a damn good idea.....of course you get 
        free admission....
JamieJ1: ..and a private bath*L*
Terry_VB: Unfortunately, I wouldn't be able to go there
JamieJ1: why's that???
Terry_VB: I can't be a hypocrite and tell people to do one 
        thing and then do what I'm telling them not to do
JamieJ1: well,,,that's why you get a private bath.....and you
        don't have to come all of the time
Terry_VB: naw, actually my sexual addiction has been 
        part of my struggle this past year
JamieJ1: everything okay?
Terry_VB: of course everything's ok
Terry_VB: Nothing ever goes wrong in my world
JamieJ1: there's the positive terry i know
Terry_VB: oh, I've back a few days now
JamieJ1: what do you mean?
Terry_VB: I was in a very bad place for a couple of weeks
JamieJ1: what kind of place?
Terry_VB: I couldn't pick myself up.  My spirit was broken
JamieJ1: times get like that....
Terry_VB: yup.  I had all but given up on myself
Terry_VB: nothing was working
JamieJ1: but you're snapped out of it
JamieJ1: you've*
Terry_VB: and I will not burden others when I am feeling 
        like that... I even withdrew from my closest friends
Terry_VB: yeah, finally.  I had a dream that kind of just 
        shook me out of it
JamieJ1: what kind of dream did you have?
Terry_VB: well, in the dream, I was at my mom's house in
        WV in their living room... and their German Shepherd,
        Sheba (who is a very sensitive dog) was lying in the 
        floor bleeding to death.  She had two arrows in her 
        chest.  She was begging me to just let her die... but I 
        just had a sudden feeling that I couldn't let her die, 
        so I pulled the arrows out and that's when I woke up
JamieJ1: that's kind of a morbid dream
Terry_VB: it is, but I understand the symbolism of it
JamieJ1: oh....as do i
Terry_VB: and then that day I just started feeling better... I 
        didn't do anything different than the day before
JamieJ1: well, i for one am glad yo uhad the dream then
Terry_VB: *nods*  me, too.  I was really starting to worry.  
        Normally I don't, because I've seen tough times 
        before... but I just couldn't shake this one
JamieJ1: well, don't dwell on it.....you're out of it and that's 
        all that matters
Terry_VB: not at all.  It is in the past.  But I learned a lot 
        about myself
JamieJ1: very good
Terry_VB: hey, do you know what time you were born?
JamieJ1: 6:02 in the am
Terry_VB: and you said your birthday is the 16th?
JamieJ1: it sure is
Terry_VB: 73, right?
JamieJ1: right again
Terry_VB: ok.  last question.  where were you born?
JamieJ1: portsmouth, va....
Terry_VB: ok
JamieJ1: and the questions are fine
Terry_VB: I want to look at your birth chart
Terry_VB: this is what it says about you
Terry_VB: You were born with the Sun in Gemini and the 
        Moon in Capricorn. Your individuality comes under 
        the influence of your Sun in Gemini, which denotes a 
        humane, intellectual, and kind disposition. Your 
        whole life will be inwardly centered through 
        education and intellectual pursuit. People regard you
        as clever. 
JamieJ1: that's me in a nutshell.....
Terry_VB: Under stress you hesitate to take a course that 
        must be hastily determined. However, what you lack 
        in this respect is completely compensated for by your
        fine intellect. You like to dwell on concepts, and you 
        have a broad humanistic view of life. You abhor 
        violence, finding it incomprehensible. If you could do 
        whatever you wanted in life, you would definitely 
        concern yourself exclusively with intellectual 
        activities.
JamieJ1: well...that's not me.....
Terry_VB: there's more...
Terry_VB: Externally, your personality does not completely
        agree with your feelings. Because of education and 
        other environmental influences, your personality has 
        been centered on achieving material goals, and you 
        have somehow identified with them completely. Your 
        inner self, however, does not coincide with these 
        matters. 
Terry_VB: It is up to you to subdue the influence of your 
        acquired personality and to let the impulses arising 
        from your inner self come out, so that your whole 
        being is better integrated.
JamieJ1: well..some of it is true...and some isn't....
Terry_VB: *nods*  you may have outgrown some of the 
        influences
JamieJ1: that i have
Terry_VB: see if this sounds like you
Terry_VB: The Sun is in the first house. You are by nature 
        energetic, proud and self-assertive. You project 
        yourself enthusiastically and energetically into all 
        situations. Your naturally outgoing disposition and 
        personable manner usually make a good 
        impression on people. 
Terry_VB: Your heightened self-perception puts you in 
        touch with a strong sense of will, and you can 
        manipulate your will to suit your aims and desires in 
        life. This position of the Sun gives the capacity for 
        leadership, for you tend to attract people and to have 
        a strong influence on them when they are with you. 
JamieJ1: for the msot part it's true...
Terry_VB: cool.  I won't paste the whole report
JamieJ1: i pretty much get the idea of it
Terry_VB: looking at a compatibility report between you 
        and me to see what it says
JamieJ1: okie doke
Terry_VB: wow, we're pretty compatible... not that I 
        needed this to tell me that
JamieJ1: i didn't think you needed that
Terry_VB: ahh... listen to this
Terry_VB: Venus conjunct Saturn in the composite chart 
        can present problems for a relationship.  Saturn 
        represses the warm and self-expressive nature of 
        Venus and can make a relationship very cold. Even if 
        there are strong feelings between you, the 
        expression of those feelings is somehow always 
        subordinated to more practical considerations.This 
        aspect particularly can prevent a sexual relationship 
        from ever being consummated, not for lack of feeling,
        but because of the considerations just mentioned. 
JamieJ1: i'm listenin....
Terry_VB: that makes sense
JamieJ1: what makes sense??????
Terry_VB: why we seem to be in and out of each other's 
        lives over the past 3-4 years and have never met or 
        consumated a sexual relationship
JamieJ1: and why is that?
Terry_VB: did you not read what I pasted?
JamieJ1: nothing posted.....all i saw was "listen to 
        this"...and that's all
Terry_VB: ahhh
Terry_VB: sorry
JamieJ1: it's okay
Terry_VB: let me try again
JamieJ1: sure
Terry_VB: Venus conjunct Saturn in the composite chart 
        can present problems for a relationship. 
Terry_VB: Saturn represses the warm and 
        self-expressive nature of Venus and can make a 
        relationship very cold. Even if there are strong 
        feelings between you, the expression of those 
        feelings is somehow always subordinated to more 
        practical considerations.
JamieJ1: okay......
Terry_VB: This aspect particularly can prevent a sexual 
        relationship from ever being consummated, not for 
        lack of feeling, but because of the considerations 
        just mentioned.
JamieJ1: okay....
Terry_VB: This aspect can have another, quite different 
        effect. Your affection may be expressed, and a sexual
        relationship may be consummated, but in a very cool
        and restrained manner. Nevertheless, the feeling is 
        genuine, and Saturn's slowing effect may make the 
        relationship steady and enduring. 
JamieJ1: ah...so that's why we've never slept together?
Terry_VB: I guess 
JamieJ1: so...when do venus and saturn meet??
Terry_VB: well, conjunct means they are already together
Terry_VB: there were lots of other great aspects between 
        us
Terry_VB: I just found that one interesting
JamieJ1: well, i knew that.....:)
Terry_VB: it was the only one I read and went "Ahhhhhh"
JamieJ1: well, i can see why you said "Ahhhhhh"
Terry_VB: yup.  
JamieJ1: well...this conversation certainly got very 
        deep.....
Terry_VB: sorry
JamieJ1: oh....that's quite alright....
JamieJ1: besides....it's nice having these long talks with 
        you again
Terry_VB: you just can't shut me up sometimes
JamieJ1: oh, that's just cause i've never tried*L*
JamieJ1: just kiddin
Terry_VB: lol
Terry_VB: most people don't
Terry_VB: it's futile
JamieJ1: lol....well then...talk away baby
Terry_VB: naw, I don't like to monopolize conversations
Terry_VB: I like to be the one who listens 
JamieJ1: so do i.....
Terry_VB: which would probably be why we always end 
        up talking about me
JamieJ1: yeah...but i like talking about you.....
Terry_VB: I am pretty entertaining
Terry_VB: ;-)
JamieJ1: lol....yes youare  ;-)
Terry_VB: and it's not like there's a lot of great company 
        online at this hour... and I"m free entertainment, so...
JamieJ1: i really should be paying for such good 
        entertainment*L*
Terry_VB: I think you should
Terry_VB: All donations are appreciated
JamieJ1: well.....all i have is one's in my wallet*L*
Terry_VB: I also accept Visa, Mastercard, and American 
        Express
JamieJ1: wow....you take it all
Terry_VB: oh.  I forgot Discover.  
Terry_VB: It pays to discover
JamieJ1: oh yeah.....can't forget discover
Terry_VB: nope
Terry_VB: you can also post date a check if you want
Terry_VB: just make it out to CASH
JamieJ1: is this an hourly charge or is it for the whole 
        month???
Terry_VB: you have two options.  You can either pay a 
        monthly membership fee, which is $49.95 for 
        unlimited hours, or you can pay an hourly rate, which 
        is more expensive... but that's how I make my $$
JamieJ1: and what do i get for my money?
Terry_VB: unlimited access to me, silly
JamieJ1: unlimited huh....sounds like a deal
Terry_VB: I think so, too
Terry_VB: you know, had I charged for all my past 
        dates/online chats, I would be very very rich
JamieJ1: i know i would have paid a huge chunk of 
        change
Terry_VB: yeah, but I couldn't justify charging you. I get 
        way more out of this than you do
JamieJ1: i don't hardly think so....i think we get the same 
        out of it
Terry_VB: nah, but you can think that if you want
JamieJ1: what do you think you get out of our chats that i 
        don't?
Terry_VB: sheer joy and exhilaration
JamieJ1: well, i get the same thing ;-)
Terry_VB: yeah, but we always talk about my problems.  
        You never vent your frustrations to me.  
JamieJ1: i really don't have many frustrations anymore.....
JamieJ1: other than all of the knuckleheads privating me 
        in chat all of the time*L*
Terry_VB: that's b/c you put a picture in there
Terry_VB: you're fresh meat
JamieJ1: i guess....i just don't react too well the "do you 
        swallow" as an opening question
Terry_VB: oh.  well, that's the new "Hi, how are you?" of 
        the queer community
JamieJ1: ah...see...this is why i need more chats with 
        you...to learn the new lingo*L*
Terry_VB: yeah, it's cut throat in the chat rooms these 
        days
JamieJ1: it must be
Terry_VB: there is no time to mess around with niceties 
        like "What's your name?"
Terry_VB: no one cares what your name is
Terry_VB: But your dick size, that is very crucial 
JamieJ1: that's a shame.....
Terry_VB: and they see that bulge in your pants in the 
        picture
Terry_VB: so they assume your'e hung
JamieJ1: well...maybe i am....*L*
Terry_VB: *shrugs*  damned if I know
JamieJ1: well...i could lie and say i'm 10 inches.....*L*
Terry_VB: I know how big you are.  You told me years ago
JamieJ1: i remember.....
JamieJ1: i'm gettin a digital camera soon so i guess i'll 
        have to post a pic of my Mr. Happy
Terry_VB: you can't call yours Mr. Happy
Terry_VB: that's my dick's name
Terry_VB: you have to come up with a name of your own
JamieJ1: well...how about Stanley.....
JamieJ1: ...like the power drill.....
Terry_VB: I like that
JamieJ1: then there it si.....my new name for it
JamieJ1: is*
Terry_VB: works for me
JamieJ1: well sexy....i think it's about time i head out
Terry_VB: okie doke
JamieJ1: don't stay up too late...okay?
Terry_VB: I hope not
Terry_VB: since you're leaving, I'll probably take some 
        nyquil and call it a night
Terry_VB: I don't have the energy to start another 
        conversation
JamieJ1: i hear that.....i'm pretty tired myself....
Terry_VB: well, you sleep tight and have a great day today
JamieJ1: this would definitely be a cuddle night only.....
Terry_VB: for who? your pillow
JamieJ1: i'm jsut sayin....no energy for anything but 
        cuddlin....
Terry_VB: *nods*  I hear ya
Terry_VB: somehow I don't believe you though
Terry_VB: you would find the energy somehow
JamieJ1: you're probably right....
Terry_VB: ;-)  I usually am  *sighs*  It's a curse
JamieJ1: lol....you're the same way so i don't want to hear
        it
Terry_VB: oh I know
Terry_VB: I could be dead an pop a boner for sex
JamieJ1: well, that's not a curse....
Terry_VB: no.  I was talking about always being right
Terry_VB: that's a curse
Terry_VB: I hope I can always find energy for sex
JamieJ1: as do i....
JamieJ1: you know times are bad when you turn down 
        sex....
Terry_VB: yup
JamieJ1: well, i have to work the next few days but i'll be 
        back on Monday....
Terry_VB: ok.  well, somehow I figure we'll find each other
        again
JamieJ1: i think we will....i've been looking for you lately
Terry_VB: that's because I've been sending out SOS 
        signals for Jamie
JamieJ1: well, i guess i've been hearing them....
Terry_VB: apparently  ;-)
JamieJ1: and i'm certainly glad you've been sending 
        them out
Terry_VB: You have always been in my thoughts... even in
        the time you weren't around
JamieJ1: well, to be honest, i've spent some time 
        thinking about you
Terry_VB: I would hope so.  I was your first internet 
        boyfriend
JamieJ1: yes you were...i've told yo things that i've never 
        told anyone else
Terry_VB: and that means the world to me
JamieJ1: i'm glad it does....
JamieJ1: i hope you know you mean a lot to me as well
Terry_VB: I do.  
Terry_VB: ;-)
JamieJ1: alright baby......i need to get going....
Terry_VB: g'nite
JamieJ1: nite....talk to you soon
Terry_VB: sleep with angels
JamieJ1: i'd give you a g'nite kiss if i could
Terry_VB: i'll just slobber a little bit and pretend you did
JamieJ1: lol....damn..i'd hate to see what you'd do if i said
        i'd give you a g'nite blowjob*LOL*
Terry_VB: lol
Terry_VB: then I won't tell you
JamieJ1: i'll just use my imagination then ;-)
Terry_VB: Just as well.  It's what I used imagining what 
        you looked like for 4 years
JamieJ1: yeah, but now you know.....
Terry_VB: now I know!
JamieJ1: yes you do....
Terry_VB: are you having trouble saying good night?
JamieJ1: actually, i'm jsut too lazy to get up from the 
        comp*L*
Terry_VB: lol
Terry_VB: been there
JamieJ1: well, i better go..as you put it i have a pillow to 
        cuddle with*L*
Terry_VB: yeah, and remember whose choice that was  
        ;-)
JamieJ1: i know....i know....
Terry_VB: good night, boo
JamieJ1: that's why i'm thinkin we're gonna hookup 
        soon.....
Terry_VB: lol
JamieJ1: alright....talk to you later......
Terry_VB: okie doke
