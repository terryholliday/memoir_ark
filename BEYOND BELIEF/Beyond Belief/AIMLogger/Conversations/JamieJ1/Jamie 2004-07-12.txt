JamieJ1: hey there
Terry_VB: hello again
JamieJ1: yeah....i had a few computer problems for a 
        second there
Terry_VB: it's all good
Terry_VB: welcome back
JamieJ1: ty
JamieJ1: so...how was your weekend?
Terry_VB: it was good.  I went home to WV for Conner's 
        birthday party
Terry_VB: how was yours?
JamieJ1: uneventful
Terry_VB: that's no good
JamieJ1: well, no...it's not...but it's alright
Terry_VB: I was thinking about you on the drive home
JamieJ1: oh really?
Terry_VB: You've never told me about your sexual 
        encounters with men
JamieJ1: no...i guess i haven't
Terry_VB: I've been horny all night... guess that's why I was 
        thinking about it
JamieJ1: lol...you're always horny
Terry_VB: not always
Terry_VB: just a lot
Terry_VB: but exceptionally tonight
Terry_VB: I haven't jerked off in a while
JamieJ1: sounds to me like you might need to
Terry_VB: probably
Terry_VB: but the night is still young
JamieJ1: of course it is....
JamieJ1: what time did you get back?
Terry_VB: midnight
JamieJ1: tonight???
Terry_VB: yeah
JamieJ1: damn....you gotta be tired
Terry_VB: a little bit.  I didn't get much sleep last night b/c 
        Conner woke me up around 8 and I had just gone to 
        bed at 4:30/5
JamieJ1: that's not much sleep at all...and how long was 
        the drive?
Terry_VB: almost 5 hours
JamieJ1: that's not too bad...i was thinking it was an 8 hour 
        or so drive
Terry_VB: nah
Terry_VB: so back to your homosexual encounters
JamieJ1: okay....what would you like to know?
Terry_VB: I wanna know whatever you'll tell me
JamieJ1: well.....first, i've still haven't had anal....
Terry_VB: yeah, I know you told me that
JamieJ1: well, it was pretty simple actually.....i met a guy 
        through work who was gay
JamieJ1: we became pretty good friends and it just kinda 
        happened
Terry_VB: you suck at story time
JamieJ1: lol
JamieJ1: oh...you want details
Terry_VB: I'm a Virgo.  My motto is DETAILS
JamieJ1: well, the first time we ever did anything.....
JamieJ1: we went out with a few friends. we had a few 
        drinks and prety much just cut loose
Terry_VB: did you kiss and make out?  What was the sex 
        like?
JamieJ1: well, we ended up leaving around 2:00 and i was 
        way too tired to head home so he said i could stay at 
        his place...we were at Bar Norfolk and he lived in 
        Norfolk
Terry_VB: ahhhh, how convenient
JamieJ1: yeah...to be honest...that's what i was thinking but
        i really didn't care at this point
Terry_VB: so then what happened once you got back to his 
        place?
JamieJ1: we got to his place and he got me a some water 
        and we sat on the couch and he turned on the tv
JamieJ1: i was looking at his movie collection and he had 
        taped about all of the Queer as Folk episodes
JamieJ1: he put in a tape and we watched it
Terry_VB: well, nothing like QAF to get ya horned up
Terry_VB: the opening credits get me aroused
JamieJ1: and i have to be honest...i was getting pretty horny
        watching it
Terry_VB: no doubt
Terry_VB: and then?
JamieJ1: i'm not sure why he made his move, but he got up
        to get some more water and when he came back he 
        sat next to me
JamieJ1: i was way into the show to say anything....i guess 
        because i didn't say anything he leaned over and 
        kissed me
JamieJ1: just a peck on the lips...but enough to get things 
        going
Terry_VB: ok, you can stop.  
Terry_VB: I can picture the rest
JamieJ1: exactly.....things jsut went from there...
JamieJ1: i have to admit....it's one of the hottest times i've 
        ever had
Terry_VB: well no kidding... it was your first m4m action, 
        wasn't it?
JamieJ1: for the most part yes.....i mean i played around a 
        little bit when i was like 14 or something...but nothing 
        like this
JamieJ1: you know, the whole puberty thing
Terry_VB: *nods*
JamieJ1: so...that was it
Terry_VB: I thought you said there was two?
JamieJ1: two guys?
Terry_VB: yeah
JamieJ1: no.....only him....there was another that i almost 
        did something with but i didn't 
Terry_VB: oh ok
Terry_VB: well, that was an exciting story once you told it
JamieJ1: the cool thing was he knew it was my first time so
        he didn't push anything
Terry_VB: *nods*
Terry_VB: I'm so glad your 1st time was great
JamieJ1: so am i.....my only stipulations were no anal and i
        didn't want him to cum in my mouth.....other than that i 
        was open for about anything
Terry_VB: you handed him a disclaimer?
JamieJ1: lol.....hey, at least it wasn't a written contract
Terry_VB: right
JamieJ1: was that a bad thing to do?
Terry_VB: I don't think so
JamieJ1: *whew*....for a moment there you had me worried
Terry_VB: naw, I'm glad you set boundaries
JamieJ1: you know....all in due time
Terry_VB: I'm sure it'll be just as great of an experience
Terry_VB: probably better
JamieJ1: i'm sure.....
JamieJ1: but, i can see i have to work on my storry 
        telling*L*
Terry_VB: I'm not sure I wanna hear that story
JamieJ1: so....
Terry_VB: lol, so?
JamieJ1: i dunno.....it jsut got quiet all of a sudden.....
Terry_VB: I thought you were going to say something
Terry_VB: lol
Terry_VB: I"m sorry
Terry_VB: I didn't mean to make it awkward
JamieJ1: oh....you didn't make anything awkward...and you 
        never have to apologize to me
Terry_VB: sure I do
Terry_VB: it's cathartic to say I'm sorry
JamieJ1: well, if you want to say it it's okay...but you don't 
        need to
Terry_VB: *nods*  I appreciate that
Terry_VB: thanks btw for putting me on your hot list 
JamieJ1: oh....it's my pleasure....it's about time i did it
Terry_VB: naw, you're supposed to put HOT guys on that 
        list.
JamieJ1: well, that's exactly what i did
Terry_VB: ooook
JamieJ1: ;-
JamieJ1: ;-)
Terry_VB: well, it was flattering
Terry_VB: and to be the only one!
Terry_VB: just shows you don't get out much
JamieJ1: and you're the only one whom i've sent my pics to
Terry_VB: I know, but this is as far as we go
JamieJ1: i don't really know what to say to that
Terry_VB: you don't have to say anything
Terry_VB: What do you feel right now?
JamieJ1: several things......too many things.....
Terry_VB: well, let me help you clear some of them up.  I 
        am content with what we have created, Jamie.  To be 
        honest with you, I am perfect content if we never create 
        anything more than what we have
Terry_VB: I gave up on that idea a long time ago... and 
        certainly since you came back into my life
JamieJ1: well, let me clear up some things up too 
        then....i'm perfectly happy with what we've created too.  
        But, ever since i went further in my sexual experience 
        i've felt kinda guilty cause i said, and i truly wanted, that
        you would be the first guy i'd be with
Terry_VB: it wasn't meant to happen that way, Jamie
Terry_VB: you shouldn't feel guilty to me, because I am 
        happy that things happened the way they did
JamieJ1: and since we began talking again, while i truly 
        am not looking for any kind of relationship with anyone 
        right now, i get urges to just come over and jump your 
        bones...
Terry_VB: lol
JamieJ1: lol
JamieJ1: i know
Terry_VB: well, that's not a bad thing to imagine
Terry_VB: but that's all it will be
JamieJ1: oh...i've imagined it quite a bit*L*
Terry_VB: woo hoo
JamieJ1: i'm not kiddin..i've jerked off more after we've 
        chatted than i can imagine*L*
Terry_VB: nothing wrong with that
JamieJ1: i know...just shows i'm healthy
Terry_VB: yup
JamieJ1: you workin tomorrow?
Terry_VB: yeah, tomorrow at 4
JamieJ1: what time you gettin off?
Terry_VB: I dunno.  We're closing early b/c it's our company 
        picnic all day/night
JamieJ1: okie doke
Terry_VB: definitely no later than 11
Terry_VB: they said we're going to stop seating at 9:30
JamieJ1: cool....i gotta wake up early and head to North 
        Carolina for a while
Terry_VB: well, get some sleep
JamieJ1: i will be soon
JamieJ1: 9 minutes
Terry_VB: tick tock
JamieJ1: i can hear the second hand ticking away*L*
Terry_VB: I am not good at small talk
Terry_VB: well, not as good as other conversation
JamieJ1: yeah you are....you've done just fine in the past
Terry_VB: well, let me go pee and use up a couple minutes
JamieJ1: minutes????...to pee???..man, you must have 
        been holdin it
Terry_VB: ok, 1 minute
JamieJ1: ok
JamieJ1: unless you're gonna do something more in 
        there*L*
Terry_VB: fuck, I hope my sister did not give me her flu
Terry_VB: I am freezing
Terry_VB: I cannot be sick!
Terry_VB: again
JamieJ1: that wouldn't be good
JamieJ1: hey...just believe that you aren't sick and it will go 
        away...it's all mental*L*
Terry_VB: well, especially since I told her that the reason 
        she got sick was she was holding in anger towards 
        my brother's girlfriend
Terry_VB: karma biting me on the ass for being 
        self-righteous
JamieJ1: uh-oh....family drama
Terry_VB: I dont' get into it
Terry_VB: I try to make peace where I can
Terry_VB: my brother and sister just have a lot of anger
JamieJ1: the best thing to do is stay out of it
Terry_VB: oh I do
Terry_VB: well, when I'm not there
JamieJ1: smart man
Terry_VB: checking my temperature now
Terry_VB: she was running a 104 temp when I was there
JamieJ1: you're fine
Terry_VB: yeah, I'm just tired from no sleep and the drive 
        home
Terry_VB: I'll feel better in the morning
JamieJ1: well, go to bed and get some sleep.
Terry_VB: I will
JamieJ1: you may just have to relieve the horniness in the 
        morning
Terry_VB: naw, I don't jerk off in the morning/day
JamieJ1: never?
Terry_VB: it's a rare occurrence
JamieJ1: well, it gives you something to look forward to at 
        night i guess
Terry_VB: yeah
Terry_VB: I just don't get horny during the day
JamieJ1: my body doesn't recognize daytime or night 
        time....it get's horny when it wants to
Terry_VB: lol
Terry_VB: well if I'm stimulated, of course
JamieJ1: oh....of course
Terry_VB: you better get to bed so you can get up in the 
        morning.  it's 4 minute past your curfew
Terry_VB: I don't want to get you in trouble
JamieJ1: well, i better get my butt to bed
Terry_VB: good idea
JamieJ1: hey...great minds think alike
Terry_VB: that we do
JamieJ1: you better do the same.....i know you're tired
Terry_VB: yeah, I am
