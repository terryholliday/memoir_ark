<DIV><SPAN class=328393808-02082002>Looking back, I'd have to say that overall, 
I had a good childhood.&nbsp; Of course there are things that I think about and 
wonder had they never happened, what would life be like now?&nbsp; But I'm 
quickly assured by my belief that everything happens for a reason, and that 
every experience or person in my life was there to teach me a valuable lesson or 
plant a seed that would grow many years later.</SPAN></DIV>

<DIV><SPAN class=328393808-02082002>When I think of my childhood, my mind is 
filled with so many memories, both good and bad, but nevertheless, 
memories.&nbsp; One of the hardest things about writing this book was choosing 
which memories and stories to share with you.&nbsp; If you stop to think about 
it, the mind is one powerful piece of machinery, storing so much information for 
a lifetime, filing and grouping bits of information and memories.&nbsp; I 
realized early in life that I had a niche for memorizing numbers.&nbsp; I can 
remember what our next-door-neighbors phone number was back when I was a little 
kid.&nbsp; Or our one neighbor, who we'd hear on our "four-party phone line" 
talking to her lover about how much she wished she could be with him.&nbsp; 
Those were good times.&nbsp; </SPAN></DIV>

<DIV><SPAN class=328393808-02082002>My neighbors played a big part of forming 
who I am today.&nbsp; My second mom, Keitha (as I liked to call her), taught me 
sarcasm and patience.&nbsp; God certainly blessed that woman with the patience 
of Job to handle all that she's handled over the years.&nbsp; About a year ago, 
she popped in my head and a memory came to me about this song she would sing 
when we'd be in her Subaru going somewhere,&nbsp; "Don't mess with my 
toot-toot."&nbsp; I had to send her a copy of it, so I downloaded it online and 
sent it to her.&nbsp; I spent a lot of my childhood at her house and her 
relatives, who were also neighbors down our road.&nbsp; They called our road 
"Holliday holler," because almost everyone who lived down that road beared the 
last name Holliday.&nbsp; My family was of a different branch.&nbsp; They were 
all Catholics and we were Baptists.&nbsp;&nbsp;I never was successful at trying 
to draw a family tree.&nbsp; My grandfather passed away, and he seemed to be the 
only link to any knowledge of our family's past.</SPAN></DIV><SPAN
