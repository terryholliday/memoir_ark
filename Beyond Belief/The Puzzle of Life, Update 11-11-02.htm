Putting my puzzle together<BR>
<DIV><STRONG><SPAN class=376530307-11112002>Hey Pat,</SPAN></STRONG></DIV>
<DIV><STRONG><SPAN class=376530307-11112002></SPAN></STRONG>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><STRONG><SPAN class=376530307-11112002>Well, I'm going back to 
school!&nbsp; I haven't figured out the exacts just yet, but I know I'm going to 
go back and major in Political Science.&nbsp; I can then go into Broadcast 
Journalism, which will open up the door for me to meet a lot of people that I'll 
need to create a media conglomerate that will relay my "message" the way that 
media does.&nbsp; I guess that's why I have always been drawn to watching the 
news.&nbsp; I can sit and watch CNN for hours on end.&nbsp; I just thirst for 
knowledge and love figuring out the politics of it using my 
intuition.</SPAN></STRONG></DIV>
<DIV><STRONG><SPAN class=376530307-11112002></SPAN></STRONG>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><STRONG><SPAN class=376530307-11112002>I was also thinking... I can help 
change people's views by the stories I told, which in turn, could influence 
politics and policy, which can change our society's views.&nbsp; I don't know 
why I didn't see this sooner.&nbsp; My cousin Jackie said it best, "You've seen 
it big, now see it small."&nbsp; I was just missing a key piece in the puzzle, 
the education part.&nbsp;</SPAN></STRONG></DIV>
<DIV><STRONG><SPAN class=376530307-11112002></SPAN></STRONG>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><STRONG><SPAN class=376530307-11112002>I guess now is actually a good time 
for me to go back to school, anyway.&nbsp; Since I'm making good money at PF 
Chang's working the hours I am, I could actually go back to school full-time and 
maybe be done in 2 1/2 years.&nbsp; I'm not really looking forward to that, but 
I did it back when I was in college before.&nbsp; The one good thing I can see 
is the homework I'm seeing me having, majoring in Political Science, would be 
interesting to me... it's stuff I've basically been doing in my spare time 
anyway.&nbsp; Only now, it'll be towards getting a degree that will open up a 
lot more doors.</SPAN></STRONG></DIV>
<DIV><STRONG><SPAN class=376530307-11112002></SPAN></STRONG>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><STRONG><SPAN class=376530307-11112002>I'm going to start checking out the 
schools in the area and their programs so I can hopefully get scholarships and 
financial aid.&nbsp; I figure I'll end up going to ODU, though.&nbsp; 
</SPAN></STRONG></DIV>
<DIV><STRONG><SPAN class=376530307-11112002></SPAN></STRONG>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><STRONG><SPAN class=376530307-11112002>As for my house situation, I'll find 
out on Monday whether I was approved for the loan.&nbsp; They prequalified me 
but apparently this is something else.&nbsp; My landlord already put the house 
on the market.&nbsp; Three people came by on Saturday.&nbsp; I gave them the 
tour, making sure to point out all the flaws in the house... but I always ended 
the statement by saying something good about the house.&nbsp; They asked me how 
the neighborhood was and how I liked it.&nbsp; I told them, "I loved the lady 
that lives to my left, but the ones on the right aren't too nice."&nbsp; I told 
them how we had Federal Marshalls come by for the lady that doesn't live there 
anymore and how the one guy parked his truck so close to my car one time that I 
had to climb through the passenger door.&nbsp; But then I said, "but other than 
that, the neighborhood is pretty good."&nbsp; My landlord pissed me off, too, 
because she didn't tell me that people were going to be coming by so soon.&nbsp; 
She just put the house on the market Friday.&nbsp; I had a training class on 
Saturday morning at work and when I got home at 10 a.m., she said two people 
were going to come by and check out the house.&nbsp; I was planning on going 
back to sleep since I had to work dinner shift at 4 p.m.&nbsp; She said she'd 
call them and tell them to not come until after 4, since I'd be at work 
then.&nbsp; Well, one showed up at 11 a.m., then the other showed up at 
1:30.&nbsp; So I figured that was all for the day since my landlord told me two 
people would come by.&nbsp; Well, I hit the..., well you know, and was watching 
Will &amp; Grace up in my room.&nbsp; At 3 p.m. I hear someone talking 
downstairs, so I go to the stairs and tell her "I'll be right down."&nbsp; I had 
to hurry up and spray Febreze in my room to cover the smoke smell and light a 
match because I had just gone to the bathroom and hit the, you know.&nbsp; Then 
I realized, "shit!" After the first two people came by, I set my office back 
up... so the spare bedroom was locked again.&nbsp; I told the last lady, "uh, 
this is my office.&nbsp; I've got so much stuff in there, you can't get 
in.&nbsp; It's just the third bedroom, just like that one, only a little 
smaller.&nbsp;"&nbsp; She had to accept that explanation.&nbsp; I wasn't going 
to open it up for her to see all my documents<EM>, </EM>ya know?&nbsp; I'm 
hoping none of them liked the house, though.&nbsp; But then again, how could 
they not? with my stelar sales pitch.&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN 
class=376530307-11112002>I'm just hoping that I get approved to buy the house 
with no money down so I don't have to move.&nbsp; I don't need that added stress 
in the next couple of months.&nbsp; I need to focus all of my energy towards 
going back to school.&nbsp; And I definitely don't want to have to move right at 
Christmas, which I would if someone buys the house now.&nbsp; But if I do, I'm 
sure I'll get it done.&nbsp; I always do.</SPAN></STRONG></DIV>
<DIV><STRONG><SPAN class=376530307-11112002></SPAN></STRONG>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><STRONG><SPAN class=376530307-11112002>I don't know if I told you the last 
time we spoke, but the tarot reading I did last week told me: 
<DIV><SPAN class=315520503-31072002><STRONG>Romance:&nbsp;</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN 
class=315520503-31072002>Though you don't see it coming, you will soon be swept 
up in a powerful love affair that is going to change your life 
dramatically.</SPAN></DIV>
<DIV><SPAN class=315520503-31072002></SPAN>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><SPAN class=315520503-31072002><STRONG>The Unexpected:&nbsp; 
</STRONG>You'll be pleasantly surprised by some unexpected good news about your 
career and positive changes in your home or work environment.&nbsp; A new 
romantic interest could also be indicated</SPAN></DIV>
<DIV><SPAN class=315520503-31072002></SPAN>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><SPAN class=315520503-31072002><SPAN class=376530307-11112002>Well, I 
started talking to this guy (Nate Lansing, 34, SGWM) in the chat room last 
week.&nbsp; The first night we met online, we ended up talking on the phone 
until 3 a.m. and then again the next night and every night since... even when he 
went away this weekend to his sister's wedding, he called.&nbsp; I can't get him 
out of my head, and he says he "thinks of me all the time, too."&nbsp; It's very 
strange, especially since we haven't met.&nbsp; The even more bizarre part to it 
is that he lives in Burlington, VT, but was in the VB chat room because he was 
thinking about moving back to VB, since he used to live here about&nbsp;6 years 
ago.&nbsp; Everything I know about him makes me think he's going to be the next 
person I fall in love with.&nbsp; I love talking to him and we can go from 
talking Politics and Religion to Philosophy questions&nbsp;and then still throw 
a flirtation twist to what we say.&nbsp; He shares your and my passtime, and 
he's a Reinassance man, too.&nbsp; He's done everything from social work to 
Construction and being a mechanic.&nbsp; </SPAN></SPAN></DIV>
<DIV><SPAN class=315520503-31072002><SPAN 
class=376530307-11112002></SPAN></SPAN>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><SPAN class=315520503-31072002><SPAN class=376530307-11112002>I so need a 
handy fag!&nbsp; That's the one area that I am lacking in.&nbsp; I'm not handy 
when it comes to house construction or cars (and I'd certainly need someone who 
was if I was a homeowner vs. renter and had a car almost 10 years old).&nbsp; 
Physically, he's what I had always envisioned I'd end up with, 5'10" (shorter 
than me, but not short).&nbsp; He's got dark hair and a cute face (I'll send you 
his pic).&nbsp; His "package" is not something to write home to mom about, but 
it's definitely do-able. (pic not attached)&nbsp; But it's our conversations 
that make me believe it's so.&nbsp; When I talk to him, I can envision us going 
to dinners and parties together and just hanging out with my cousin 
Jackie.&nbsp; I've always wanted to fall in love with someone who could be my 
best friend as well as my lover, which I guess everyone does.&nbsp; I certainly 
never had that with Buddy.&nbsp; We just never connected on that level.&nbsp; I 
know I could be wrong about Nate, and he and I even talked about people having a 
"game plan" but having free will to change that plan.&nbsp;&nbsp;But I'm 
trusting my intuition on this one.&nbsp; With all the infatuations I've had 
since I broke up with Buddy, none of them felt "right" when I took that part of 
my life and compared it to my plans and future.&nbsp; Mike in DC inspired me to 
write that "A New Day Has Come" story and&nbsp;I thought he could be the one, 
and I had great intelligent conversations with him, but he couldn't make me 
laugh.&nbsp; He had a Frasier only sense of humor, where I have that sense of 
humor and the Will &amp; Grace sense of humor, too.&nbsp; I had great 
intelligent conversations with Mike from VB, and I was incredibly head over 
heels infatuated with him.&nbsp; He was the one that&nbsp;inspired me to write 
the poem "One Wish," but&nbsp;he and I didn't have the sexual energy.&nbsp; Adam 
(I sent you his pictures. 19 year old, big tool) gave me the sexual energy that 
I needed, but couldn't be trusted to lend $60.&nbsp; Each of them had 
one&nbsp;of the great things that I always wanted in a partner, but none of 
them&nbsp;quite fit the bill of what I had always envisioned as the person I'd 
end up with.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nate is the first guy I've met that's had all of them 
AND was interested in me.&nbsp; The way I look at it, each of those 
relationships up to now were to teach me about those certain things about myself 
and themselves that would prepare me for this next level in my life 
romantically, which I think might be Nate.&nbsp; </SPAN></SPAN><SPAN 
class=315520503-31072002><SPAN class=376530307-11112002>Of course,&nbsp;I've 
been wrong about people before, and even though I know I've said "I think this 
guy could be the one" quite a few times before, too,&nbsp;with the last few 
tarot readings I've done, and learning to trust my intuition more every day, I'm 
going to wager that this one is going to pan out to be something more.&nbsp;
